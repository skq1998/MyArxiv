$^1D_2$ transition in atomic strontium, achieved through frequency
comb-referenced laser-induced-fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. We excite the
5s$^2$ $^1S_0$ - 5s5p $^1P_1$ transition using an on-resonance laser at
$\approx$461 nm, and then measure the variation in the LIF signal while
scanning the laser at $\approx$767 nm across the 5s5p $^1P_1$ - 5s5d $^1D_2$
transition. We determine the absolute frequency of $390599571.7\pm0.4$ MHz,
with an accuracy that surpasses the previous most accurate measurement by two
orders of magnitude. This measurement technique can be readily applied for
precision spectroscopy of high-lying states not only in strontium, but also in
other atomic species.

                                        <span>  Short-wavelength repulsive potentials for quantum gases allow to realize new
systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive
optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at
wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system
to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of
dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.
We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to
manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes
exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting
directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.

                                        <span>  We show that resonant absorption of smooth laser fields can yield Mollow-like
triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and
illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not
exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the
pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi
cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to
emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the
high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric,
which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic
physics.

interference in the $D_2$ manifold of $^{39}K$ vapor, in addition to the usual
single Electromagnetically induced transparency peak. The other two features
appear exclusively because $^{39}K$ ground hyperfine splitting is smaller than
the Doppler broadened absorption profile. This allows probe and control beams
to swap their transition pathways. The control beam detuning captures the
nature of the coherence, therefore an unusual phenomenon of conversion from
perfect transparency to enhanced absorption is observed and explained by
utilizing adiabatic elimination of the excited state in the Master equation.
Controlling such dark and bright resonances leads to new applications in
quantum technologies viz. frequency offset laser stabilization and long-lived
quantum memory.

profile in the regime dominated by the velocity-changing collisions. We derive
general formulas for the effective width and shift of the Lorentzian for
arbitrary speed-dependent collisional broadening and shift and
velocity-changing collision operators. For a quadratic speed dependence of
collisional broadening and shift, and the billiard ball model of
velocity-changing collisions, we provide simple analytical expressions for the
effective Lorentzian width and shift. We show that the effective Lorentzian
width and shift split into components originating from the: well-known
Dicke-narrowed Doppler width, speed-averaged collisional broadening and shift,
their speed dependencies, and a product term that mixes the contributions of
the broadening and shift speed dependencies. We show how the components depend
on rates of speed-changing and velocity-changing collisions related to the
perturber/absorber mass ratio. We validate analytical formulas numerically on
example of H$_{2}$ transition perturbed by He.

                                        <span>  One-dimensional quantum optical models usually rest on the intuition of large
scale separation or frozen dynamics associated with the different spatial
dimensions, for example when studying quasi one-dimensional atomic dynamics,
potentially resulting in the violation of $3+1D$ Maxwell's theory. Here, we
provide a rigorous foundation for this approximation by means of the
light-matter interaction. We show how the quantized electromagnetic field can
be decomposed $-$ exactly $-$ into an infinite number of subfields living on a
lower dimensional subspace and containing the entirety of the spectrum when
studying axially symmetric setups, such as with an optical fiber, a laser beam
or a waveguide. The dimensional reduction approximation then corresponds to a
truncation in the number of such subfields that in turn, when considering the
interaction with for instance an atom, corresponds to a modification to the
atomic spatial profile. We explore under what conditions the standard approach
is justified and when corrections are necessary in order to account for the
dynamics due to the neglected spatial dimensions. In particular we will examine
what role vacuum fluctuations and structured laser modes play in the validity
of the approximation.

                                        <span>  Verifying equivalence between two quantum circuits is a hard problem, that is
nonetheless crucial in compiling and optimizing quantum algorithms for
real-world devices. This paper gives a Turing reduction of the (universal)
quantum circuits equivalence problem to weighted model counting (WMC). Our
starting point is a folklore theorem showing that equivalence checking of
quantum circuits can be done in the so-called Pauli-basis. We combine this
insight with a WMC encoding of quantum circuit simulation, which we extend with
support for the Toffoli gate. Finally, we prove that the weights computed by
the model counter indeed realize the reduction. With an open-source
implementation, we demonstrate that this novel approach can outperform a
state-of-the-art equivalence-checking tool based on ZX calculus and decision
diagrams.

                                        <span>  The decades-old Pattern Matching with Edits problem, given a length-$n$
string $T$ (the text), a length-$m$ string $P$ (the pattern), and a positive
integer $k$ (the threshold), asks to list all fragments of $T$ that are at edit
distance at most $k$ from $P$. The one-way communication complexity of this
problem is the minimum amount of space needed to encode the answer so that it
can be retrieved without accessing the input strings $P$ and $T$.
  The closely related Pattern Matching with Mismatches problem (defined in
terms of the Hamming distance instead of the edit distance) is already well
understood from the communication complexity perspective: Clifford, Kociumaka,
and Porat [SODA 2019] proved that $\Omega(n/m \cdot k \log(m/k))$ bits are
necessary and $O(n/m \cdot k\log (m|\Sigma|/k))$ bits are sufficient; the upper
bound allows encoding not only the occurrences of $P$ in $T$ with at most $k$
mismatches but also the substitutions needed to make each $k$-mismatch
occurrence exact.
  Despite recent improvements in the running time [Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka,
and Wellnitz; FOCS 2020 and 2022], the communication complexity of Pattern
Matching with Edits remained unexplored, with a lower bound of $\Omega(n/m
\cdot k\log(m/k))$ bits and an upper bound of $O(n/m \cdot k^3\log m)$ bits
stemming from previous research. In this work, we prove an upper bound of
$O(n/m \cdot k \log^2 m)$ bits, thus establishing the optimal communication
complexity up to logarithmic factors. We also show that $O(n/m \cdot k \log m
\log (m|\Sigma|))$ bits allow encoding, for each $k$-error occurrence of $P$ in
$T$, the shortest sequence of edits needed to make the occurrence exact.
  We leverage the techniques behind our new result on the communication
complexity to obtain quantum algorithms for Pattern Matching with Edits.

                                        <span>  Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians have found attention in
the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with
several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the
Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization
opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with
the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this
article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians
and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of
Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians
depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a
tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched
Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the
emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched
Hamiltonians.

                                        <span>  Quantum error mitigation techniques mimic noiseless quantum circuits by
running several related noisy circuits and combining their outputs in
particular ways. How well such techniques work is thought to depend strongly on
how noisy the underlying gates are. Weakly-entangling gates, like
$R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ for small angles $\theta$, can be much less noisy than
entangling Clifford gates, like CNOT and CZ, and they arise naturally in
circuits used to simulate quantum dynamics. However, such weakly-entangling
gates are non-Clifford, and are therefore incompatible with two of the most
prominent error mitigation techniques to date: probabilistic error cancellation
(PEC) and the related form of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). This paper
generalizes these techniques to non-Clifford gates, and comprises two
complementary parts. The first part shows how to effectively transform any
given quantum channel into (almost) any desired channel, at the cost of a
sampling overhead, by adding random Pauli gates and processing the measurement
outcomes. This enables us to cancel or properly amplify noise in non-Clifford
gates, provided we can first characterize such gates in detail. The second part
therefore introduces techniques to do so for noisy $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates.
These techniques are robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors,
and exhibit concentration and sensitivity--crucial features in many
experiments. They are related to randomized benchmarking, and may also be of
interest beyond the context of error mitigation. We find that while
non-Clifford gates can be less noisy than related Cliffords, their noise is
fundamentally more complex, which can lead to surprising and sometimes unwanted
effects in error mitigation. Whether this trade-off can be broadly advantageous
remains to be seen.

                                        <span>  Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and
quantum sensing. In levitated nanomechanics, squeezed states of motion can be
generated via temporal control of the trapping frequency of a massive particle.
However, the amount of achievable squeezing typically suffers from detrimental
environmental effects. We analyze the performance of a scheme that, by
embedding careful time-control of trapping potentials and fully accounting for
the most relevant sources of noise -- including measurement backaction --
achieves significant levels of mechanical squeezing. The feasibility of our
proposal, which is close to experimental state-of-the-art, makes it a valuable
tool for quantum state engineering.

                                        <span>  Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes
quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing,
the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a
quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of
entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can
deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is
constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled
resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can
rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical
FPGA-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore
the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local,
multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we
demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both
protocols for implementing an unbounded fan-out (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT) gate
in constant depth between three non-local qubits. Finally, we demonstrate
deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on
opposite side of our quantum processor.

performance and interpretability of trained models in classical machine
learning. On the other hand, the usability of conventional feature selection
could be limited for quantum machine learning tasks; the technique might not
provide a clear interpretation on embedding quantum circuits for classical data
tasks and, more importantly, is not applicable to quantum data tasks. In this
work, we propose a feature selection method with a specific focus on quantum
machine learning. Our scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum
models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the
corresponding local quantum kernels. We numerically demonstrate its versatility
for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of
classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3)
compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for
quantum data. The proposed framework paves the way towards applications of
quantum machine learning to practical tasks. Also, this technique could be used
to practically test if the quantum machine learning tasks really need
quantumness, while it is beyond the scope of this work.

                                        <span>  Random number generators (RNGs) are notoriously hard to build and test,
especially in a cryptographic setting. Although one cannot conclusively
determine the quality of an RNG by testing the statistical properties of its
output alone, running numerical tests is both a powerful verification tool and
the only universally applicable method. In this work, we present and make
available a comprehensive statistical testing environment (STE) that is based
on existing statistical test suites. The STE can be parameterised to run
lightweight (i.e. fast) all the way to intensive testing, which goes far beyond
what is required by certification bodies. With it, we benchmark the statistical
properties of several RNGs, comparing them against each other. We then present
and implement a variety of post-processing methods, in the form of randomness
extractors, which improve the RNG's output quality under different sets of
assumptions and analyse their impact through numerical testing with the STE.

this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by
coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our
analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal
defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique
entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective
central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the
transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission
coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central
charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT
extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.

quantum systems. It becomes particularly interesting in two-dimension (2D),
where the superfluidity with quasi-long-range order emerges via
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism, which still remains elusive
with dipolar interactions. Here, we observe the BKT transition from a normal
gas to the superfluid phase in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms.
Controlling the orientation of dipoles, we characterize the transition point by
monitoring extended coherence and measuring the equation of state. This allows
us to gain a systematic understanding of the BKT transition based on an
effective short-range description of dipolar interaction in 2D. Additionally,
we observe anisotropic density fluctuations and non-local effects in the
superfluid regime, which establishes the dipolar nature of the 2D superfluid.
Our results lay the ground for understanding the behavior of dipolar bosons in
2D and open up opportunities for examining complex orders in a dipolar
superfluid.

systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive
optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at
wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system
to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of
dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.
We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to
manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes
exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting
directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.

triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and
illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not
exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the
pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi
cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to
emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the
high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric,
which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic
physics.

                                        <span>  Quantum computing promises a disruptive impact on machine learning
algorithms, taking advantage of the exponentially large Hilbert space
available. However, it is not clear how to scale quantum machine learning (QML)
to industrial-level applications. This paper investigates the scalability and
noise resilience of quantum generative learning applications. We consider the
training performance in the presence of statistical noise due to finite-shot
noise statistics and quantum noise due to decoherence to analyze the
scalability of QML methods. We employ rigorous benchmarking techniques to track
progress and identify challenges in scaling QML algorithms, and show how
characterization of QML systems can be accelerated, simplified, and made
reproducible when the QUARK framework is used. We show that QGANs are not as
affected by the curse of dimensionality as QCBMs and to which extent QCBMs are
resilient to noise.

to any local observable measured on any product state or on any state with
exponentially decaying correlations. Our results do not require the spins to be
arranged in a regular lattice, and cover the case of observables that contain
terms acting on spins at arbitrary distance. Moreover, we introduce a local W1
distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to
local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the
local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially
decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy.
Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the
canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the
weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs
states have exponentially decaying correlations.

ring can exhibit local flow patterns inconsistent with its angular momentum, a
phenomenon known as quantum backflow. In this study, we examine a quantum
particle confined to a ring and prepared in a state composed of a fixed (yet
arbitrary) number of lowest energy eigenstates with non-negative angular
momentum. We investigate the time-dependent behavior of the probability current
at a specified point along the ring's circumference. We establish precise lower
and upper bounds for this probability current, thereby delineating the exact
scope of the quantum backflow effect. We also present an analytical expression
for a quantum state that yields a record-high backflow probability transfer,
reaching over 95% of the theoretical bound. Furthermore, our investigation
yields compelling numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture
that the current-versus-time function associated with states maximizing
backflow probability transfer forms a fractal curve with a dimension of 7/4.
The observed fractality may provide a characteristic, experimentally-relevant
signature of quantum backflow near the probability-transfer bound.

                                        <span>  While the phenomenon of the exact crossing of energy levels is a rarely
occurring event, in the case of quantum resonances associated with metastable
states this phenomenon is much more frequent and various scenarios can occur.
When there is an exact crossing of the imaginary parts of the resonances in a
two-level quantum system subject to an external DC electric field, then a
damped beating phenomenon occurs, which is absent if there is no such crossing.
This fact, tested numerically on an explicit one-dimensional model, suggests
the possibility of designing quantum sensors to determine in a very simple way
whether the external field strength has an assigned value or not.

node and 795nm photonic time-bin qubits compatible with Thulium and Rubidium
quantum memories. The interface makes use of two-stage low-noise quantum
frequency conversion and waveform shaping to match temporal and spectral photon
profiles. Two-photon quantum interference shows high indistinguishability of
(89.5 $\pm$ 1.9)% between converted 795nm photons and the native NV center
photons. We use the interface to demonstrate quantum teleportation including
real-time feedforward from an unbiased set of 795nm photonic qubit input states
to the NV center spin qubit, achieving a teleportation fidelity of (75.5 $\pm$
1.0)%. This proof-of-concept experiment shows the feasibility of
interconnecting different quantum network hardware.

local decomposable group actions, covering matrix product unitaries (MPUs),
using an operator algebraic approach. We focus on finite group symmetries
hosting both symmetric and symmetry broken phases. The local-decomposable group
actions we consider have a 3-cocycle class of the symmetry group associated to
them. We derive invariants for our classification that naturally cover
one-dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. We prove that
these invariants coincide with the ones of [J. Garre Rubio et al, Quantum 7,
927 (2023)] using matrix product states (MPSs) techniques, by explicitly
working out the GNS representation of MPSs and MPUs, resulting in a useful
dictionary between both approaches that could be of independent interest.

                                        <span>  Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered
growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand et
al., arXiv:2306.11457] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using
a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in
a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite
fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from
an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its
asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the
theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by
incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the
general linear growth law analytically. We find that it quantitatively
describes the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting
parameters.

                                        <span>  We propose a recipe for demonstrating an autonomous quantum heat engine where
the working fluid consists of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of which is
tuned by a driving mode. The working fluid is coupled two heat reservoirs each
exhibiting a peaked power spectrum, a hot reservoir peaked at a higher
frequency than the cold reservoir. Provided that the driving mode is
initialized in a coherent state with a high enough amplitude and the parameters
of the utilized optomechanical Hamiltonian and the reservoirs are appropriate,
the driving mode induces an approximate Otto cycle for the working fluid and
consequently its oscillation amplitude begins to increase in time. We build
both an analytical and a non-Markovian quasiclassical model for this quantum
heat engine and show that reasonably powerful coherent fields can be generated
as the output of the quantum heat engine. This general theoretical proposal
heralds the in-depth studies of quantum heat engines in the non-Markovian
regime. Further, it paves the way for specific physical realizations, such as
those in optomechanical systems, and for the subsequent experimental
realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine.

                                        <span>  Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous
symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal
structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave
functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to
be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform
to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms.
Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements
of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a
hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here,
with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate
vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline
order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation
of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference
in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids.
This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum
systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains
such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.

                                        <span>  The application of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to non-Hermitian
quantum systems has become one of the most important topics in dissipative
quantum chaos, recently giving rise to intense debates. The process of
thermalization is intricate, involving many time-evolution trajectories in the
reduced Hilbert space of the system. By considering two different expansion
forms of the density matrices adopted in the biorthogonal and right-state time
evolutions, we have derived two versions of the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations describing the
non-Hermitian systems coupled to a bosonic heat bath in thermal equilibrium. By
solving the equations, we have identified a sufficient condition for
thermalization under both time evolutions, resulting in Boltzmann biorthogonal
and right-eigenstate statistics, respectively. This finding implies that the
recently proposed biorthogonal random matrix theory needs an appropriate
revision. Moreover, we have exemplified the precise dynamics of thermalization
and thermodynamic properties with test models.

effect and the topology. We start by reviewing the non-Bloch band theory of the
static non-Hermitian systems and discuss the establishment of its generalized
bulk-boundary correspondence. Ultimately, we focus on the non-Bloch band theory
of two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems: harmonically driven
non-Hermitian system and periodically quenched non-Hermitian system. The
non-Bloch topological invariants were defined on the generalized Brillouin zone
and the real space wave functions to characterize the Floquet non-Hermtian
topological phases. Then, the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence was
established for the two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems.
Additionally, we review novel phenomena in the higher-dimensional periodically
driven non-Hermitian systems, including Floquet non-Hermitian higher-order
topological phases and Floquet hybrid skin-topological modes. The experimental
realizations and recent advances have also been surveyed. Finally, we end with
a summarization and hope this pedagogical review can motivate further research
on Floquet non-Hermtian topological physics.

                                        <span>  The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a
Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd
as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an
operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via
appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the
canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part
of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain
the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the
pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons
initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher
information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the
gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the
bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For
a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound
of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude
measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term
approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next
consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over
time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the
square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced
by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which
it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the
Bose-Einstein condensate which results in a decoherence. We observe that the
decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.

symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge
excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose
a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from
a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input
from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by
numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also
study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as
energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical
predictions.

                                        <span>  In variational quantum algorithms, constraints are usually added to the
problem objective via penalty terms. For linear inequality constraints, this
procedure requires additional slack qubits. Those extra qubits tend to blow up
the search space and complicate the parameter landscapes to be navigated by the
classical optimizers. In this work, we explore approaches to model linear
inequalities for quantum algorithms without these drawbacks. More concretely,
our main suggestion is to omit the slack qubits completely and evaluate the
inequality classically during parameter tuning. We test our methods on QAOA as
well as on Trotterized adiabatic evolution, and present empirical results. As a
benchmark problem, we consider different instances of the multi-knapsack
problem. Our results show that removing the slack bits from the circuit
Hamiltonian and considering them only for the expectation value yields better
solution quality than the standard approach. The tests have been carried out
using problem sizes up to 26 qubits. Our methods can in principle be applied to
any problem with linear inequality constraints, and are suitable for
variational as well as digitized versions of adiabatic quantum computing.

                                        <span>  The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics
in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task
that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble)
approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections. Their importance remains
elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical
arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate
calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to
thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional
Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing
vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero
electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite
temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to
the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these
limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce
important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison
to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately
local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully
capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales
between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections
are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and
may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the
values of model parameters.

                                        <span>  Entangled photons provide transformative new paths in the fields of
communication, sensing, and computing. However, when entangled photons
propagate through a complex medium such as a biological tissue or a turbulent
atmosphere, their correlations are scrambled. Using wavefront shaping to
compensate for the scattering and retrieve the two-photon correlations is
challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the two-photon signal.
While previous works partly addressed this challenge by using feedback from a
strong classical laser beam that co-propagates with the entangled photons, such
methods frequently depend on assumptions about the complex medium, limiting the
applicability of quantum wavefront shaping. In this work, we propose and
demonstrate a new feedback mechanism that is inspired by Klyshko's advanced
wave picture, in which the classical laser beam counter-propagates with one of
the entangled photons and co-propagates with the other. The new Klyshko
feedback allows compensation of scattering in thick samples and even in
situations where each photon propagates through a different scattering medium.
Since the advanced wave picture applies whenever optical reciprocity is valid,
such Klyshko optimization can be utilized across a wide range of
configurations, offering a robust and alignment-free setup. We therefore
believe this protocol will open the door for real-world applications of quantum
wavefront shaping.

interference in the $D_2$ manifold of $^{39}K$ vapor, in addition to the usual
single Electromagnetically induced transparency peak. The other two features
appear exclusively because $^{39}K$ ground hyperfine splitting is smaller than
the Doppler broadened absorption profile. This allows probe and control beams
to swap their transition pathways. The control beam detuning captures the
nature of the coherence, therefore an unusual phenomenon of conversion from
perfect transparency to enhanced absorption is observed and explained by
utilizing adiabatic elimination of the excited state in the Master equation.
Controlling such dark and bright resonances leads to new applications in
quantum technologies viz. frequency offset laser stabilization and long-lived
quantum memory.

                                        <span>  Excitons, as bound states of electrons and holes, embody the solid state
analogue of the hydrogen atom, whose quantum spectrum is explained within a
classical framework by the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model. In a first
hydrogenlike approximation the spectra of excitons are also well described by a
Rydberg series, however, due to the surrounding crystal environment deviations
from this series can be observed. A theoretical treatment of excitons in
cuprous oxide needs to include the band structure of the crystal, leading to a
prominent fine-structure splitting in the quantum spectra. This is achieved by
introducing additional spin degrees of freedom into the system, making the
existence and meaningfulness of classical exciton orbits in the physical system
a non-trivial question. Recently, we have uncovered the contributions of
periodic exciton orbits directly in the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra
of cuprous oxide [J. Ertl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067401 (2022)] by
application of a scaling technique and fixing the energy of the classical
dynamics to a value corresponding to a principle quantum number $n=5$ in the
hydrogenlike case. Here, we present a comprehensive derivation of the classical
and semiclassical theory of excitons in cuprous oxide. In particular, we
investigate the energy dependence of the exciton dynamics. Both the
semiclassical and quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit stronger
deviations from the hydrogenlike behavior with decreasing energy, which is
related to a growing influence of the spin-orbit coupling and thus a higher
velocity of the secular motion of the exciton orbits. The excellent agreement
between semiclassical and quantum mechanical exciton recurrence spectra
demonstrates the validity of the classical and semiclassical approach to
excitons in cuprous oxide.

                                        <span>  Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has
been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can
be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that
photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a
nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling
between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a
biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the
photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in
contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity.
We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output
field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for
two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the
experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system
strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities, and also predict a
biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field. Our proposed scheme is
universal and can be extended to enhance blockade in other bosonic systems.

equipped with two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles in diamonds. One of the NV
ensembles serves as the spin source, while the other functions as the spin
sensor. By coherently manipulating the quantum states of two NV ensembles and
their relative velocity at the micrometer scale, we are able to scrutinize
exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent interactions at short force ranges. For a
T-violating interaction, $V_6$, new limits on the corresponding coupling
coefficient, $f_6$, have been established for the force range shorter than 1
cm. For a P,T-violating interaction, $V_{14}$, new constraints on the
corresponding coupling coefficient, $f_{14}$, have been obtained for the force
range shorter than 1 km.

                                        <span>  The dynamics of a quantum system are characterized by three components:
quantum state, quantum process, and quantum measurement. The proper measurement
of these components is a crucial issue in quantum information processing.
Recently, direct measurement methods have been proposed and demonstrated
wherein each complex matrix element of these three components is obtained
separately, without the need for quantum tomography of the entire matrix. Since
these direct measurement methods have been proposed independently, no
theoretical framework has been presented to unify them despite the time
symmetry of quantum dynamics. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework
to systematically derive direct measurement methods for these three components.
Following this framework and further utilizing the basis-shift unitary
transformation, we have derived the most efficient direct measurement method
using qubit probes. Additionally, we have experimentally demonstrated the
feasibility of the direct measurement method of quantum states using optical
pulse trains.

exponential-type spinor orbitals are introduced. They provide a revised form
for operator invariants, namely Dirac invariants, simplifying the treatment of
the angular components in calculation of many-electron systems. The
relativistic Coulomb energy is determined by employing a spectral solution to
Poisson's equation for the one$-$electron potential, which is expressed in
terms of radial functions involving incomplete gamma functions. The computation
for incomplete gamma functions posses challenges due to slow convergence rate
associated with their series representation. Such difficulties are eliminated
through use of the bi-directional method along with hyper-radial functions. A
new formulation for relativistic auxiliary functions that improve the
efficiency in Coulomb energy calculations is presented. These formulations also
contribute to inquiring into orthogonal expansions for solutions to Poisson's
equation using complete orthonormal sets of exponential orbitals with
non-integer principal quantum numbers. They may provide a meaningful
alternative series representations.

                                        <span>  Quantum computers have the potential to change the way we solve computational
problems. Due to the noisy nature of qubits, the need arises to correct
physical errors occurring during computation. The surface code is a promising
candidate for such error correction that shows high threshold and which can
store a logical quantum state on hardware with square-grid connectivity, a type
of device that already exists. However, for logical quantum computation, the
measurement of some irregular, non-local stabilisers is required, and it is not
currently known how to do this without modifying the connectivity of the
hardware. Here, we present a method to achieve this, closing this gap on the
path to fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a method of tangled
syndrome extraction circuits, which enables measurement of observables between
distant qubits. As an application of our tangling technique, we show how to
measure the aforementioned irregular non-local stabilisers, without physically
modifying the hardware itself. We present a concrete scheme that enables
general lattice surgery with the planar code. Therefore, tangling enables
fault-tolerant logical quantum computation using the surface code on
square-grid connectivity architectures.

                                        <span>  The ZX-calculus is a powerful framework for reasoning in quantum computing.
It provides in particular a compact representation of matrices of interests. A
peculiar property of the ZX-calculus is the absence of a formal sum allowing
the linear combinations of arbitrary ZX-diagrams. The universality of the
formalism guarantees however that for any two ZX-diagrams, the sum of their
interpretations can be represented by a ZX-diagram. We introduce a general,
inductive definition of the addition of ZX-diagrams, relying on the
construction of controlled diagrams. Based on this addition technique, we
provide an inductive differentiation of ZX-diagrams.
  Indeed, given a ZX-diagram with variables in the description of its angles,
one can differentiate the diagram according to one of these variables.
Differentiation is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics and quantum computing (e.g.
for solving optimization problems). Technically, differentiation of ZX-diagrams
is strongly related to summation as witnessed by the product rules.
  We also introduce an alternative, non inductive, differentiation technique
rather based on the isolation of the variables. Finally, we apply our results
to deduce a diagram for an Ising Hamiltonian.

                                        <span>  Reservoir computing is a versatile paradigm in computational neuroscience and
machine learning, that exploits the non-linear dynamics of a dynamical system -
the reservoir - to efficiently process time-dependent information. Since its
introduction, it has exhibited remarkable capabilities in various applications.
As widely known, classes of reservoir computers serve as universal
approximators of functionals with fading memory. The construction of such
universal classes often appears context-specific, but in fact, they follow the
same principles. Here we present a unified theoretical framework and we propose
a ready-made setting to secure universality. We test the result in the arising
context of quantum reservoir computing. Guided by such a unified theorem we
suggest why spatial multiplexing may serve as a computational resource when
dealing with quantum registers, as empirically observed in specific
implementations on quantum hardware. The analysis sheds light on a unified view
of classical and quantum reservoir computing.

                                        <span>  Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of
chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos
and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal
dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative
form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum
systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation
modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local
Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged
over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the
limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always
relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by
the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust
ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime,
relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains
nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is
taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a
recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our
findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space
dimension.

insulating and superconducting states of twisttronics materials. While
quasiperiodicity was up to now a notion mostly reserved for solid-state
materials and cold atoms, we here demonstrate the capacity of conventional
superconducting circuits to emulate moir\'e physics in charge space. With two
examples, we show that Hofstadter's butterfly and the magic-angle effect, are
directly visible in spectroscopic transport measurements. Importantly, these
features survive in the presence of harmonic trapping potentials due to
parasitic linear capacitances. Our proposed platform benefits from
unprecedented tuning capabilities, and opens the door to probe incommensurate

error-correcting codes. In this work, we develop several optimization tools
that can potentially reduce the space and time overhead required for flag
fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) with lookup table decoding on
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. Our techniques include the compact lookup
table construction, the Meet-in-the-Middle technique, the adaptive time
decoding for flag FTQEC, the classical processing technique for flag
information, and the separated $X$ and $Z$ counting technique. We evaluate the
performance of our tools using numerical simulation of hexagonal color codes of
distances 3, 5, 7, and 9 under circuit-level noise. Combining all tools can
result in more than an order of magnitude increase in pseudothreshold for the
hexagonal color code of distance 9, from $(1.34 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-4}$ to
$(1.42 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-3}$.

preceded by coherent diffusion. By studying three paradigmatic 1D models,
namely the Harper-Hofstadter-Aubry-Andr\'e and Fibonacci tight-binding chains,
along with the power-banded random matrix model, we show that whenever coherent
diffusion is present, transport is exceptionally stable against decoherent
noise. This is completely at odds with what happens for coherently ballistic
and localized dynamics, where the diffusion coefficient strongly depends on the
environmental decoherence. A universal dependence of the diffusion coefficient
on the decoherence strength is analytically derived: the diffusion coefficient
remains almost decoherence-independent until the coherence time becomes
comparable with the mean elastic scattering time.
  Thus, systems with a quantum diffusive regime could be used to design robust
quantum wires. Moreover our results might shed new light on the functionality
of many biological systems, which often operate at the border between the
ballistic and localized regimes.

                                        <span>  We demonstrate that collective vibrational strong coupling of molecules in
thermal equilibrium can give rise to significant local electronic polarizations
in the thermodynamic limit. We do so by first showing that the full
non-relativistic Pauli-Fierz problem of an ensemble of strongly-coupled
molecules in the dilute-gas limit reduces in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer
approximation to a cavity-Hartree equation for the electronic structure.
Consequently, each individual molecule experiences a self-consistent coupling
to the dipoles of all other molecules, which amount to non-negligible values in
the thermodynamic limit (large ensembles). Thus collective vibrational strong
coupling can alter individual molecules strongly for localized "hotspots"
within the ensemble. Moreover, the discovered cavity-induced polarization
pattern possesses a zero net polarization, which resembles a continuous form of
a spin glass (or better polarization glass). Our findings suggest that the
thorough understanding of polaritonic chemistry, requires a self-consistent
treatment of dressed electronic structure, which can give rise to numerous, so
far overlooked, physical mechanisms.

single parameter two-qubit circuits which are locally equivalent to special
perfect entanglers. We present the results obtained from the implementation of
one of the circuits using cross-resonance interaction and discuss their
applications. First, we show that the ability of two-qubit gates to create
entangled states can be described using the chords present in the argand
diagram of squared eigenvalues of nonlocal part of two-qubit gates. We show
that the entangling power of a two-qubit gate is proportional to the mean
squared length of the chords. We deduce the entangling characteristics of
special perfect entanglers from the argand diagram associated with them. We
implement a special perfect entangler circuit using echoed cross-resonance gate
and pulse-level programming for nine different circuit parameters. For a
particular input state, we perform quantum state tomography and calculate state
fidelity and concurrence of the obtained output density matrices. We also
measure the average gate fidelity for B gate circuit. We construct two
universal two-qubit quantum circuits using the special perfect entangler
circuits. These universal circuits can be used to generate all two-qubit gates.
We show that (n-1) B gate circuits can be used to generate n-qubit GHZ and
perfect W states. We generate three-qubit perfect W state. Perfect W state
generated using pulse-level programming shows better fidelity than the state
generated using echoed cross-resonance gate.

control-theoretic observability decomposition. We derive a Hermitian operator
representing instantaneous dissipation of observable energy, and suggest a
generalization of the von-Neumann entropy which can account for the
model-uncertainty also present in pure states if the measured observables are
informationally incomplete. In this view, the transition from a fundamental to
a thermodynamic model consists in mapping the fundamental density matrix to an
effective one, generally of lower dimension, encoding only what is observable
given the constraints of our sensor and actuator capabilities. The generalized
entropy captures the information loss incurred in this mapping. The theory is
illustrated for the central spin model, where we show that the application of
external controls can increase the size of thermal fluctuations and lower the
entropy.

to enhance its security and efficiency. Unextendible Product Bases (UPBs) hold
promise in quantum cryptography due to their inherent indistinguishability, yet
they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This work introduces a protocol
utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically,
we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice
sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The
protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the
cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including
intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are
noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our
protocol for eavesdroppers, thereby enhancing QKD security.

problems and has emerged as an essential quantum subroutine in various complex
algorithms. This research extensively investigates Grover's search methodology
within non-uniformly distributed databases, a scenario frequently encountered
in practical applications. Our analysis reveals that the behavior of the Grover
evolution differs significantly when applied to non-uniform databases compared
to uniform or 'unstructured databases'. It is observed that the search process
facilitated by this evolution does not consistently result in a speed-up, and
we have identified specific criteria for such situations. Furthermore, we have
extended this investigation to databases characterized by coherent states,
confirming the speed-up achieved through Grover evolution via rigorous
numerical verification. In conclusion, our study provides an enhancement to the
original Grover algorithm, offering insights to optimize implementation
strategies and broaden its range of applications.

ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $J>0$ and antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $J'<0$, in the presence of the
single-ion (SI) anisotropy $D$. We first reveal the condition for the emergence
of zero-excitation-energy states. In the isotropic case with $\Delta=\Delta'=1$
($\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are the corresponding anisotropy parameters), a
threshold of $J/|J'|$ above which the ground state is ferromagnetic is
determined by exact diagonalization for short chains up to $12$ sites. Using a
set of exact two-magnon Bloch states, we then map the two-magnon problem to a
single-particle one on an effective open chain with both NN and NNN hoppings.
The whole two-magnon excitation spectrum is calculated for large systems and
the commensurate-incommensurate transition in the lowest-lying mode is found to
exhibit different behaviors between $S=1/2$ and higher spins due to the
interplay of the SI anisotropy and the NNN interaction. For the commensurate
momentum $k=-\pi$, the effective lattice is decoupled into two NN open chains
that can be exactly solved via a plane-wave ansatz. Based on this, we
analytically identify in the $\Delta'-D/|J'|$ plane the regions supporting the
SI or NNN exchange two-magnon bound states near the edge of the band. In
particular, we prove that there always exists a lower-lying NN exchange
two-magnon bound state near the band edge for arbitrary $S\geq 1/2$. Finally,
we numerically calculate the $n$-magnon spectra for $S=1/2$ with $n\leq5$ by
using a spin-operator matrix element method. The corresponding $n$-magnon

                                        <span>  One-dimensional quantum optical models usually rest on the intuition of large
scale separation or frozen dynamics associated with the different spatial
dimensions, for example when studying quasi one-dimensional atomic dynamics,
potentially resulting in the violation of $3+1D$ Maxwell's theory. Here, we
provide a rigorous foundation for this approximation by means of the
light-matter interaction. We show how the quantized electromagnetic field can
be decomposed $-$ exactly $-$ into an infinite number of subfields living on a
lower dimensional subspace and containing the entirety of the spectrum when
studying axially symmetric setups, such as with an optical fiber, a laser beam
or a waveguide. The dimensional reduction approximation then corresponds to a
truncation in the number of such subfields that in turn, when considering the
interaction with for instance an atom, corresponds to a modification to the
atomic spatial profile. We explore under what conditions the standard approach
is justified and when corrections are necessary in order to account for the
dynamics due to the neglected spatial dimensions. In particular we will examine
what role vacuum fluctuations and structured laser modes play in the validity
of the approximation.

pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the
interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to
provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on
the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the
system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's
principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement,
as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the
initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the
cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero,
and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the
Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal
state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal
pure quantum (CTPQ) state.

                                        <span>  The topology of non-Hermitian systems is fundamentally changed by the
non-Hermitian skin effect, which leads to the generalized bulk-boundary
correspondence. Based on the non-Bloch band theory, we get insight into the
interplay between the non-Hermiticity and the second-order topological
superconductors in two spatial dimensions. We investigate that the
non-Hermiticity drives both the bulk states and topological edge modes to
accumulate toward opposite corners of the system depending on the particle and
hole degrees of freedom protected by the particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore,
the degeneracy of the Majorana corner modes can be broken in terms of both the
eigenenergies and the eigenstates. Through an edge theory analysis, we
elucidate the impact of non-Hermiticity and enable the extension of
higher-order topological superconductors to the realm of non-Hermitian systems.
We show that $Z_2$ skin effect and $Z_2$ skin-topological modes reveal the
universal characteristics of non-Hermitian second-order topological
superconductors and the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence is further
enriched by the particle-hole symmetry.

problems, such as prime factorization, combinatorial optimization, simulation
of many-body physics, and quantum chemistry. While being key to understanding
many real-world phenomena, simulation of non-conservative quantum dynamics
presents a challenge for unitary quantum computation. In this work, we focus on
simulating non-unitary parity-time symmetric systems, which exhibit a
distinctive symmetry-breaking phase transition as well as other unique features
that have no counterpart in closed systems. We show that a qutrit, a
three-level quantum system, is capable of realizing this non-equilibrium phase
transition. By using two physical platforms -- an array of trapped ions and a
superconducting transmon -- and by controlling their three energy levels in a
digital manner, we experimentally simulate the parity-time symmetry-breaking
phase transition. Our results indicate the potential advantage of multi-level
(qudit) processors in simulating physical effects, where additional accessible
levels can play the role of a controlled environment.

                                        <span>  In dynamic quantum circuits, classical information from mid-circuit
measurements is fed forward during circuit execution. This emerging capability
of quantum computers confers numerous advantages that can enable more efficient
and powerful protocols by drastically reducing the resource requirements for
certain core algorithmic primitives. In particular, in the case of the
$n$-qubit quantum Fourier transform followed immediately by measurement, the
scaling of resource requirements is reduced from $O(n^2)$ two-qubit gates in an
all-to-all connectivity in the standard unitary formulation to $O(n)$
mid-circuit measurements in its dynamic counterpart without any connectivity
constraints. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of dynamic quantum circuits for
the quantum Fourier transform on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware with
certified process fidelities of $>50\%$ on up to $16$ qubits and $>1\%$ on up
to $37$ qubits, exceeding previous reports across all quantum computing
platforms. These results are enabled by our contribution of an efficient method
for certifying the process fidelity, as well as of a dynamical decoupling
protocol for error suppression during mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward
within a dynamic quantum circuit that we call ``feed-forward-compensated
dynamical decoupling" (FC-DD). Our results demonstrate the advantages of
leveraging dynamic circuits in optimizing the compilation of quantum
algorithms.

                                        <span>  Quantum master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of open
quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical
solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison
for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an
analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider
the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second
(Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master
equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave
approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these
master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and
triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms
the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit
frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff $\omega_c$),
where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian
effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL
approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in
units of $\omega_c^{-1}$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian
approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly,
as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The
fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance
in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods
to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.

fractional quantum Hall edges proximitized with an s-wave superconductor. Here
we consider parafermion and Cooper pair tunneling, and backscattering in a
junction formed in such hybrid structures. We find that the $4\pi m$
periodicity due to parafermion-only tunneling reduces, in the presence of
backscattering, to $4\pi$-periodic at zero temperature and $2\pi$-periodic at
finite temperature unless the fermion parity is fixed. Nevertheless, a clear
signature of parafermion tunneling remains in the shape of the current-phase
relation.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces Fermihedral, a compiler framework focusing on
discovering the optimal Fermion-to-qubit encoding for targeted Fermionic
Hamiltonians. Fermion-to-qubit encoding is a crucial step in harnessing quantum
computing for efficient simulation of Fermionic quantum systems. Utilizing
Pauli algebra, Fermihedral redefines complex constraints and objectives of
Fermion-to-qubit encoding into a Boolean Satisfiability problem which can then
be solved with high-performance solvers. To accommodate larger-scale scenarios,
this paper proposed two new strategies that yield approximate optimal solutions
mitigating the overhead from the exponentially large number of clauses.
Evaluation across diverse Fermionic systems highlights the superiority of
Fermihedral, showcasing substantial reductions in implementation costs, gate
counts, and circuit depth in the compiled circuits. Real-system experiments on
IonQ's device affirm its effectiveness, notably enhancing simulation accuracy.

                                        <span>  Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to
identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal
field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long
boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in
two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical
method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost.
Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully
extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the
environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced
density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of
our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing
controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes,
establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a
huge freedom degree of environment.

                                        <span>  Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians have found attention in
the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with
several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the
Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization
opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with
the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this
article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians
and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of
Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians
depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a
tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched
Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the
emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched
Hamiltonians.

                                        <span>  We investigate the full counting statistics (FCS) of a harmonically confined
1d short-range Riesz gas consisting of $N$ particles in equilibrium at finite
temperature. The particles interact with each other through a repulsive
power-law interaction with an exponent $k>1$ which includes the Calogero-Moser
model for $k=2$. We examine the probability distribution of the number of
particles in a finite domain $[-W, W]$ called number distribution, denoted by
$\mathcal{N}(W, N)$. We analyze the probability distribution of $\mathcal{N}(W,
N)$ and show that it exhibits a large deviation form for large $N$
characterised by a speed $N^{\frac{3k+2}{k+2}}$ and by a large deviation
function of the fraction $c = \mathcal{N}(W, N)/N$ of the particles inside the
domain and $W$. We show that the density profiles that create the large
deviations display interesting shape transitions as one varies $c$ and $W$.
This is manifested by a third-order phase transition exhibited by the large
deviation function that has discontinuous third derivatives. Monte-Carlo (MC)
simulations show good agreement with our analytical expressions for the
corresponding density profiles. We find that the typical fluctuations of
$\mathcal{N}(W, N)$, obtained from our field theoretic calculations are
Gaussian distributed with a variance that scales as $N^{\nu_k}$, with $\nu_k =
(2-k)/(2+k)$. We also present some numerical findings on the mean and the
variance. Furthermore, we adapt our formalism to study the index distribution
(where the domain is semi-infinite $(-\infty, W])$, linear statistics (the
variance), thermodynamic pressure and bulk modulus.

the recurrence coefficients. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the

to any local observable measured on any product state or on any state with
exponentially decaying correlations. Our results do not require the spins to be
arranged in a regular lattice, and cover the case of observables that contain
terms acting on spins at arbitrary distance. Moreover, we introduce a local W1
distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to
local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the
local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially
decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy.
Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the
canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the
weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs
states have exponentially decaying correlations.

                                        <span>  We provide definitive proof of the logarithmic nature of the percolation
conformal field theory in the bulk by showing that the four-point function of
the density operator has a logarithmic divergence as two points collide and
that the same divergence appears in the operator product expansion (OPE) of two
density operators. The right hand side of the OPE contains two operators with
the same scaling dimension, one of them multiplied by a term with a logarithmic
singularity. Our method involves a probabilistic analysis of the percolation
events contributing to the four-point function. It does not require algebraic
considerations, nor taking the $Q \to 1$ limit of the $Q$-state Potts model,
and is amenable to a rigorous mathematical formulation. The logarithmic
divergence appears as a consequence of scale invariance combined with
independence.

using an operator algebraic approach. We focus on finite group symmetries
hosting both symmetric and symmetry broken phases. The local-decomposable group
actions we consider have a 3-cocycle class of the symmetry group associated to
them. We derive invariants for our classification that naturally cover
one-dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. We prove that
these invariants coincide with the ones of [J. Garre Rubio et al, Quantum 7,
927 (2023)] using matrix product states (MPSs) techniques, by explicitly
working out the GNS representation of MPSs and MPUs, resulting in a useful
dictionary between both approaches that could be of independent interest.

                                        <span>  The Gross-Neveu model is a quantum field theory model of Dirac fermions in
two dimensions with a quartic interaction term. Like Yang-Mills theory in four
dimensions, the model is renormalizable (but not super-renormalizable) and
asymptotically free (i.e. its short-distance behaviour is governed by the free
theory). We give a new construction of the massive Euclidean Gross-Neveu model
in infinite volume based on the renormalization group flow equation. The
construction does not involve cluster expansion or discretization of
phase-space. We express the Schwinger functions of the Gross-Neveu model in
terms of the effective potential and construct the effective potential by
solving the flow equation using the Banach fixed point theorem. Since we use
crucially the fact that fermionic fields can be represented as bounded
operators our construction does not extend to models including bosons. However,
it is applicable to other asymptotically free purely fermionic theories such as
the symplectic fermion model.

of the Dirac operator, subject to infinite-mass boundary conditions. We study
the optimality of the regular polygon (respectively, disk) among all polygons
of a given number of sides (respectively, arbitrary sets), subject to area or
perimeter constraints. We consider the three lowest positive eigenvalues and
their ratios. Roughly, we find results analogous to known or expected for the
Dirichlet Laplacian, except for the third eigenvalue which does not need to be
minimised by the regular polygon (respectively, the disk) for all masses. In
addition to the numerical results, a new, mass-dependent upper bound to the
lowest eigenvalue in rectangles is proved and its extension to arbitrary

                                        <span>  The notion of pre-Poisson algebras was introduced by Aguiar in his study of
zinbiel algebras and pre-Lie algebras. In this paper, we first introduce
NS-Poisson algebras as a generalization of both Poisson algebras and
pre-Poisson algebras. An NS-Poisson algebra has an associated sub-adjacent
Poisson algebra. We show that a Nijenhuis operator on a Poisson algebra deforms
the structure into an NS-Poisson algebra. The semi-classical limit of an
NS-algebra deformation and a suitable filtration of an NS-algebra produce
NS-Poisson algebras. On the other hand, $F$-manifold algebras were introduced
by Dotsenko as the underlying algebraic structure of $F$-manifolds. We also
introduce NS-$F$-manifold algebras as a simultaneous generalization of
NS-Poisson algebras, $F$-manifold algebras and pre-$F$-manifold algebras. In
the end, we show that Nijenhuis deformations of $F$-manifold algebras and the
semi-classical limits of NS-pre-Lie algebra deformations have NS-$F$-manifold
algebra structures.

                                        <span>  Numerical simulations of turbulent flows are well known to pose extreme
computational challenges due to the huge number of dynamical degrees of freedom
required to correctly describe the complex multi-scale statistical correlations
of the velocity. On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the
Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows,
stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which
results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here we demonstrate that, by
properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the
quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an
alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach towards
subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically we show that by
leveraging on data from fully resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data
we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver
(the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid
closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning
problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational
costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers
superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky
model, being less dissipative and, therefore, being able to more closely
capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations.

                                        <span>  The work examines a special behavior of the magnetic conductivity of metals
that arises when chaotic electron trajectories appear on the Fermi surface.
This behavior is due to the scattering of electrons at singular points of the
dynamic system describing the dynamics of electrons in $\, {\bf p}$-space, and
caused by small-angle scattering of electrons on phonons. In this situation,
the electronic system is described by a "non-standard" relaxation time, which
plays the main role in a certain range of temperature and magnetic field
values.

focusing on analytic vortex solutions to the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, whose
governing equation is the so-called Jackiw-Pi equation. The equation is one of
the integrable vortex equations and is reduced to Liouville's equation. The
requirement of continuity of the Higgs field strongly restricts the
characteristics and the fundamental domain of the vortices. Also considered are
the decompactification limits of the vortices on a torus, in which "flux loss"

right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family
of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and
only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the
energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories
along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T
\overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the
deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N =
\overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T
\overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical
background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds
with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual
$U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to
describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall
systems.

                                        <span>  A unified analytical solution is presented for constructing the phase space
near collinear libration points in the Circular Restricted Three-body Problem
(CRTBP), encompassing Lissajous orbits and quasihalo orbits, their invariant
manifolds, as well as transit and non-transit orbits. Traditional methods could
only derive separate analytical solutions for the invariant manifolds of
Lissajous orbits and halo orbits, falling short for the invariant manifolds of
quasihalo orbits. By introducing a coupling coefficient {\eta} and a
bifurcation equation, a unified series solution for these orbits is
systematically developed using a coupling-induced bifurcation mechanism and
Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Analyzing the third-order bifurcation equation
reveals bifurcation conditions for halo orbits, quasihalo orbits, and their
invariant manifolds. Furthermore, new families of periodic orbits similar to
halo orbits are discovered, and non-periodic/quasi-periodic orbits, such as
transit orbits and non-transit orbits, are found to undergo bifurcations. When
{\eta} = 0, the series solution describes Lissajous orbits and their invariant
manifolds, transit, and non-transit orbits. As {\eta} varies from zero to
non-zero values, the solution seamlessly transitions to describe quasihalo
orbits and their invariant manifolds, as well as newly bifurcated transit and
non-transit orbits. This unified analytical framework provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the complex phase space structures near
collinear libration points in the CRTBP.

                                        <span>  Quantum connections are defined by parallel transport operators acting on a
Hilbert space. They transport tangent operators along paths in parameter space.
The metric tensor of a Riemannian manifold is replaced by an inner product of
pairs of operator fields, similar to the inner product of the Kubo-Mori
formalism of Linear Response Theory. The metric is used to define the dual of a
quantum connection.The gradient of the parallel transport operators is the
quantum vector potential. It defines the covariant derivative of operator
fields. The covariant derivatives are used to quantify the holonomy of the
quantum connection. It is shown that a quantum connection is holonomic if and
only if its dual is holonomic. If the parallel transport operators are unitary
then an alpha-family of quantum connections can be defined in a way similar to
Amari's alpha family of connections in Information Geometry. The minus alpha
connection is the dual of the alpha connection. In particular, the alpha equal
zero connection is self-dual. An operator field can be combined with a path in
parameter space to produce a path in operator space. A definition is given for
such a path in operator space to be autoparallel. The path in parameter space
is then a geodesic for the induced connection.

for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics
on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are
described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau
threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the
literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does
not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to
explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations.
Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and
include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states
counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized
Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in
quiver gauge theories.

                                        <span>  The study of elastic surface waves under impedance boundary conditions has
become an intensive field of research due to their potential to model a wide
range of problems. However, even when the secular equation, which provides the
speed of the surface wave, can be explicitly derived, the analysis is limited
to specific cases due to its cumbersome final expression. In this work, we
present an alternative method based on linear algebra tools, to deal with the
secular equation for surface waves in an isotropic elastic half-space subjected
to non-standard boundary conditions of impedance type. They are defined by
proportional relationships between both the stress and velocity components at
the surface, with complex proportional ratios. Our analysis shows that the
associated secular equation does not vanish in the upper complex half-plane
including the real axis. Interestingly, the full impedance boundary conditions
proposed by Godoy et al. [Wave Motion 49 (2012), 585-594] arise as a particular
limit case. An approximation technique is introduced, in order to extend the
analysis from the original problem to Godoy's impedance boundary conditions. As
a result, it is shows that the secular equation with full Godoy's impedance
boundary condition does not vanish outside the real axis. This is a crucial
property for the well-posedness of the boundary value problem of partial
differential equations, and thus crucial for the model to explain surface wave
propagation. Due to the cumbersome secular equation, this property has been
verified only for particular cases of the impedance boundary condition, namely
the stress-free boundary condition (zero impedance) and when either one of the
impedance parameter is set to zero (normal and tangential impedance cases).

temperature $\beta=2$ and external potential $Q(z)=|z|^2-2c \log|z-a|$, where
$c>0$ and $a \in \mathbb{C}$. Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$
eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \times (c+1) N$
conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$.
Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition:
it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the
pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of
the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric
example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar
Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic
behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre
matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a
duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the
smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a
refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the
partial Schlesinger transform.

There are many interesting examples such as a Poisson structure, a twisted

                                        <span>  Non-local quantum field theories could be a solution to the inconsistencies
arising when quantizing gravity. Doubly special relativity is regarded as a
low-energy limit of a quantum gravity theory with testable predictions. We
present a new formulation of quantum field theories in doubly special
relativity with non-local behavior. Our construction restricts the models to
those showing linear Lorentz invariance. The deformed Klein--Gordon, Dirac, and
electromagnetic Lagrangians are derived. The deformed Maxwell equations and the
electric potential of a point charge are discussed.

                                        <span>  The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives
rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In
this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by
coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our
analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal
defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique
entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective
central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the
transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission
coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central
charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT
extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.

independent background metric with $g_{0j}\neq 0$ is investigated. An explicit
calculation shows that when there is no background electrostatic or
magnetostatic field the thermodynamic pressure, energy density, and thermally
averaged energy-momentum tensor depend on temperature and chemical potential
only through the ratios $T_{0}/\sqrt{g_{00}}$ and $\mu_{0}/\sqrt{g_{00}}$. A
background magnetostatic field does not change this, however with a background
electrostatic field the previous results are multiplied by a factor
$\exp(-eA_{0}/T_{0})$, which is an exception to the strict Tolman-Ehrenfest
rule because the system is open.

in (1+1) dimensional abelian Higgs model with a sextic potential were studied.
The effective force exerted on a domain wall was derived from a linearized
equation and compared with numerical simulations of the original model. It was
shown that the domain walls always accelerate in one direction, regardless of
the direction of the incoming wave. This implies that in some cases an effect
called negative radiation pressure is observed, i.e. instead of pushing, the
wave pulls the soliton.

                                        <span>  We provide definitive proof of the logarithmic nature of the percolation
conformal field theory in the bulk by showing that the four-point function of
the density operator has a logarithmic divergence as two points collide and
that the same divergence appears in the operator product expansion (OPE) of two
density operators. The right hand side of the OPE contains two operators with
the same scaling dimension, one of them multiplied by a term with a logarithmic
singularity. Our method involves a probabilistic analysis of the percolation
events contributing to the four-point function. It does not require algebraic
considerations, nor taking the $Q \to 1$ limit of the $Q$-state Potts model,
and is amenable to a rigorous mathematical formulation. The logarithmic
divergence appears as a consequence of scale invariance combined with
independence.

recently discovered by Teo and Wan, we investigate the innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO) for massive particles and the circular orbit for massless
particles moving around a spinning black hole binary. We assume equal masses
$M_1 = M_2=m$ and equal spin angular momenta $|J_1| = |J_2|$ for both black
holes. Firstly, we examine the case where two black holes are spinning in the
same direction ($J_1=J_2$). We clarify that that for particles rotating in the
same direction as (opposite directions to) black holes' spin, the greater the
spin angular momenta of the black holes, the more the radii of the ISCO for
massive particles and the circular orbit for massless particles decrease
(increase). We show that distinct ISCO transitions occur for particles rotating
in the same direction as the black holes in three ranges of spin angular
momenta: $0<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2< 0.395...$, $0.395...<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2< 0.483...$,
and $0.483...<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2<0.5$. Conversely, particles rotating in the
opposite direction to the black holes exhibit a consistent transition pattern
for the case $0<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2<0.5$. Secondly, we study the situation where
binary black holes are spinning in opposite directions ($J_1=-J_2$). We clarify
that for large (small) separations between black holes, the ISCO appears near
the black hole that is spinning in the same (opposite) direction as particles'
rotation. Additionally, we show that different ISCO transitions occur in the
three angular momentum ranges: $0<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2< 0.160...$,
$0.160...<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2< 0.467...$, and $0.467...<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2<0.5$.

                                        <span>  The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a
Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd
as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an
operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via
appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the
canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part
of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain
the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the
pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons
initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher
information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the
gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the
bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For
a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound
of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude
measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term
approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next
consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over
time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the
square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced
by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which
it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the
Bose-Einstein condensate which results in a decoherence. We observe that the
decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.

fluctuations on the Skyrme brane, characterized by a time-dependent
perturbative function $\tilde{\phi}$. In the low-energy regime, the model
successfully reproduces standard inflation, with a potential term dictated by
the Skyrmion at the brane. Gravity localization is achieved at the brane, and
the lowest energy scale is established at the asymptotic boundary. The model
demonstrates the capability to emulate standard inflation dynamics, resembling
$\tilde{\phi}^4$ potential characteristics under certain conditions. At higher
energy levels, the behaviour of $\tilde{\phi}$ is contingent upon the Skyrme
term coupling constant $\lambda$, influencing reheating phases. The wave-like
nature of fluctuations allows for energy transfer, resulting in a possibly
lower reheating temperature. We also discuss the prospect of $\lambda$ changing
sign during inflation, presenting a non-standard coupling dependent on the
matter field.

paradox. As an example, in dS$_{2}$ multiverse model there are entanglement
islands in crunching regions encoding the information of regions near future
infinity of inflating or Minkowski bubbles, however, for two observers in
different bubbles, since their island regions overlap, both observers will be
able to get access to the information encoded in the overlapping region,
indicating a violation of no-cloning theorem. In this paper, we present a
different resolution to this paradox. Based on the Petz
$\mathrm{R\acute{e}nyi}$ mutual information, we show that besides the quantum
extremal surfaces there might be another boundary for the island in
corresponding spacetime so that the island regions are bounded by ``division
points" rather than extending to the rest of the entire spacetime. We also
discuss the implications of our result.

symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge
excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose
a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from
a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input
from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by
numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also
study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as
energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical
predictions.

Brown-Henneaux asymptotic Killing vectors can be derived by requiring both the
worldsheet equations of motion and Virasoro constraints are preserved near the
asymptotic boundary of the target spacetime. The charges on the worldsheet that
generate the corresponding transformations can be written down in both the
Lagrangian formalism and Hamiltonian formalism. This provides a method of
studying asymptotic symmetry of the target spacetime directly from worldsheet
string theories, without using results from the supergravity limit. As an
example, we apply this method to flat spacetime in three dimensions and obtain
the BMS$_3$ generators on the worldsheet theory.

Hamiltonian is the position operator of the Harmonic oscillator. This model
captures the high temperature limit of DSSYK but could also be defined as a
quantum theory in its own right. We study properties of the emergent geometry
including its dynamics in response to inserting matter particles. In
particular, we find that the model displays de Sitter-like properties such as
that infalling matter reduces the rate of growth of geodesic slices between the
two boundaries. The simplicity of the model allows us to compute the full
generating functional for correlation functions of the length mode or any
number of matter operators. We provide evidence that the effective action of
the geodesic length between boundary points is non-local. Furthermore, we use
the on-shell solution for the geodesic lengths between any two boundary points
to reconstruct an effective bulk metric and reverse engineer the dilaton

                                        <span>  An analytic method to calculate the vortex number on a torus is constructed,
focusing on analytic vortex solutions to the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, whose
governing equation is the so-called Jackiw-Pi equation. The equation is one of
the integrable vortex equations and is reduced to Liouville's equation. The
requirement of continuity of the Higgs field strongly restricts the
characteristics and the fundamental domain of the vortices. Also considered are
the decompactification limits of the vortices on a torus, in which "flux loss"
phenomena occasionally occur.

right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family
of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and
only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the
energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories
along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T
\overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the
deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N =
\overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T
\overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical
background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds
with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual
$U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to
describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall
systems.

dimension $n=4$. Then extending the usual $4\times 4$ tetrads (vierbein),
gravity is described in terms of the 5-bein (f\"unfbein or five legs). We
discuss the properties of the spacetime geometry induced from this 5-leg Dirac
spinor theory, where the spin connection contains $10\times 4=40$ elements
instead of 24 elements in the tetrad formulation of the general relativity
theory.

Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic

                                        <span>  The usual approach to Kaluza-Klein considers a spacetime of the form $M_4
\times K$ and identifies the isometry group of the internal vacuum metric,
$g_K^0$, with the gauge group in four dimensions. In these notes we discuss a
variant approach where part of the gauge group does not come from full
isometries of $g_K^0$, but instead comes from weaker internal symmetries that
only preserve the Einstein-Hilbert action on $K$. Then the weaker symmetries
are spontaneously broken by the choice of vacuum metric and generate massive
gauge bosons within the Kaluza-Klein framework, with no need to introduce ad
hoc Higgs fields. Using the language of Riemannian submersions, the classical
mass of a gauge boson is calculated in terms of the Lie derivatives of $g_K^0$.
These massive bosons can be arbitrarily light and seem able to evade the
standard no-go arguments against chiral fermionic interactions in Kaluza-Klein.
As a second main theme, we also question the traditional assumption of a
Kaluza-Klein vacuum represented by a product Einstein metric. This should not
be true when that metric is unstable. In fact, we argue that the unravelling of
the Einstein metric along certain instabilities is a desirable feature of the
model, since it generates inflation and allows some metric components to change
length scale. In the case of the Lie group $K = SU(3)$, the unravelling of the
bi-invariant metric along an unstable perturbation also breaks the isometry
group from $( SU(3) \times SU(3)) / Z_3$ down to $( SU(3) \times SU(2) \times
U(1) )/ Z_6$, the gauge group of the Standard Model. We briefly discuss
possible ways to stabilize the internal metric after that first symmetry
breaking and produce an electroweak symmetry breaking at a different mass
scale.

                                        <span>  In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a
black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a
generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field
Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned
observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of
impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field
massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit.
We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as
massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation
integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some
analytical results using stationary phase approximation. Interestingly, we also
show that the $\lambda_4 \varphi^4$ interaction vertex does not contribute to
the radiation by showing that the integral has no non-zero finite value.

                                        <span>  We study the evolution of abelian $U(1)$ electromagnetic as well as
non-abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields, in the presence of space-time oscillations.
Analysis of the time evolution of abelian gauge fields shows the presence of
parametric resonance in spatial modes. A similar analysis in the case of
non-abelian gauge fields, in the linear approximation, shows the presence of
the same resonant spatial modes. The resonant modes induce large fluctuations
in physical observables including those that break the $CP-$symmetry. We also
carry out time evolution of small random fluctuations of the gauge fields,
using numerical simulations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. These simulations
help to study non-linear effects in the case of non-abelian gauge theories. Our
results show that there is an increase in energy density with the coupling, at
late times. These results suggest that gravitational waves may excite
non-abelian gauge fields more efficiently than electromagnetic fields. Also,
gravitational waves in the early Universe and from the merger of neutron stars,
black holes etc. may enhance $CP-$violation and generate an imbalance in chiral
charge distributions, magnetic fields etc.

                                        <span>  Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of
chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos
and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal
dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative
form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum
systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation
modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local
Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged
over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the
limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always
relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by
the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust
ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime,
relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains
nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is
taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a
recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our
findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space
dimension.

                                        <span>  We use the Jordan frame-Einstein frame correspondence to explore dual
universes with contrasting cosmological evolutions. We study the mapping
between Einstein and Jordan frames where the Einstein frame universe describes
the late-time evolution of the physical universe, which is driven by dark
energy and non-relativistic matter. The Brans-Dicke theory of gravity is
considered to be the dual scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame. We show
that an Einstein frame universe, with cosmological evolution of the
$\Lambda$CDM model, always corresponds to a bouncing Jordan frame universe
governed by a Brans-Dicke theory. On the other hand, quintessence models of
dark energy with non-relativistic matter component are shown to be always dual
to a Brans-Dicke Jordan frame with a turn-around, i.e., a bounce or a collapse.
The evolution of the equation of state of the quintessence field determines
whether the turn-around is a bounce or a collapse. The point of the Jordan
frame turn-around for all the cases can be tuned anywhere by choosing an
appropriate Brans-Dicke parameter. This essentially leads to alternative
descriptions of the late-time evolution of the physical universe, in terms of
bouncing or collapsing Brans-Dicke universes in the Jordan frame. Therefore,the
effect of dark energy can equivalently be seen as collapse of space in a
conformally connected universe. We further study the stability of such
conformal maps against linear perturbations. The effective bouncing and
collapsing descriptions of the current accelerating universe may have
interesting implications for the evolutions of perturbations and quantum
fluctuations in the cosmological background.

oscillates in the embedding fields associated with the near-horizon two-sphere.

                                        <span>  This article primarily investigates the existence of the charged compact star
under the conformal motion treatment within the context of f(Q) gravity. We
have developed two models by implementing the power-law and linear form of
conformal factor, enabling an in-depth comparison in our study. We have
selected the MIT Bag model equation of state to describe the connection between
pressure and energy density and matched the interior spherically symmetric
space-time with the Bardeen space-time. In addition, the present research
examines various physically valid characteristics of realistic stars, such as
PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and SMC X-1. We compare two
constructed models by attributing the behavior of density, pressure,
equilibrium conditions, and the adiabatic index. We have additionally included
a brief analysis of the scenario involving Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as an
external geometry for the matching condition. In contrast to the
Reissner-Nordstrom instance, the Bardeen model with the extra term in the
asymptotic representations yields a more intriguing and viable result. The
current analysis reveals that the resulting compact star solutions are
physically acceptable and authentic when considering the presence of charge
with conformal motion in f(Q) gravity.

                                        <span>  We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of
a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues
for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics
on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are
described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau
threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the
literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does
not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to
explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations.
Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and
include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states
counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized
Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in
quiver gauge theories.

                                        <span>  Recently it has been shown that Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators of
colour-kinematic duality for tree-level scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills
theory (coupled with scalars) can be determined using a quasi-shuffle Hopf
algebra. In this paper we consider the same theory, but with higher-derivative
corrections of the forms $\alpha' F^3$ and $\alpha'^2 F^4$, where $F$ is the
field strength. In the heavy mass limit of the scalars, we show that the BCJ
numerators of these higher-derivative theories are governed by the same Hopf
algebra. In particular, the kinematic algebraic structure is unaltered and the
derivative corrections only arise when mapping the abstract algebraic
generators to physical BCJ numerators. The underlying kinematic Hopf algebra
enables us to obtain a compact expression for the BCJ numerators of any number
of gluons and two heavy scalars for amplitudes with higher-derivative
operators. The pure gluon BCJ numerators can also be obtained from our results
by a simple factorisation limit where the massive particles decouple.

pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the
interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to
provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on
the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the
system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's
principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement,
as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the
initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the
cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero,
and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the
Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal
state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal
pure quantum (CTPQ) state.

terms and self-energy corrections based on quantum field theory. We adopt an
effective power counting scheme with $\hbar$ expansion to obtain the
leading-order perturbative solutions of the vector and axial Wigner functions
and the corresponding kinetic equations. We observe that both the onshell
relation and the structure of Wigner functions, along with the kinetic
equations, are modified due to the presence of self-energies and their
space-time gradients. We further apply our formalism to investigate the spin
polarization phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions and derive the
modification to the spin polarization spectrum of massive quarks. We find that
the gradient of vector self-energy plays a similar role to the background
electromagnetic fields, which induces a more dominant contribution than the
collisional effects by a naive power counting in the gradient expansion and
weak coupling. Our findings could further modify the spin polarization of
strange quarks and spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons beyond local thermal
equilibrium.

theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the
internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS)
spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase
space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong
that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist
at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric
coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the
corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces
always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such
surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically
complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.

nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and
compare the methods of our calculation to the recently published work of Burns
et al. [1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within
$2\sigma$ by $0.011 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.055$. However, as first noted in
[1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and
experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.

renormalization group(HWRG) and stochastic quantization(SQ) motivated by the
similarity of the monotonicity in RG flow with Langevin dynamics of

with its generic mass, self-interaction, and boundary deformation in the
momentum space. Identifying the stochastic time $t$ with radial coordinate $r$
in AdS, we establish maps between the fictitious time evolution of stochastic
multi point correlation function and the radial evolution of multi-trace
deformation, which respectively, express the relaxation process of Langevin
dynamics and holographic RG flow. We especially consider marginal multi-trace
deformation on the AdS boundary which is successfully captured by a Langevin
dynamics of SQ.

auxiliary vector and the identification of the tensor structure as an auxiliary
propagator. This key insight allows us to express a wide range of one-loop
integrals, encompassing both tensor structures and higher poles, in the Baikov
representation. By establishing an integral-by-parts (IBP) relation, we derive
a recursive formula that systematically solves the one-loop reduction problem,
even in the presence of various degenerate cases. Our proposed strategy is
characterized by its simplicity and effectiveness, offering a significant
advancement in the field of one-loop calculations.

                                        <span>  Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to
identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal
field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long
boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in
two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical
method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost.
Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully
extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the
environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced
density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of
our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing
controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes,
establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a
huge freedom degree of environment.

                                        <span>  Neutron stars (NSs) are compact objects that host the densest forms of matter
in the observable universe, providing unique opportunities to study the
behaviour of matter at extreme densities. While precision measurements of NS
masses through pulsar timing have imposed effective constraints on the equation
of state (EoS) of dense matter, accurately determining the radius or moment of
inertia (MoI) of a NS remains a major challenge. This article presents a
detailed review on measuring the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession effect in the
orbit of binary pulsars, which would give access to the MoI of NSs and offer
further constraints on the EoS. We discuss the suitability of certain classes
of binary pulsars for measuring the LT precession from the perspective of
binary star evolution, and highlight five pulsars that exhibit properties
promising to realise these goals in the near future. Finally, discoveries of
compact binaries with shorter orbital periods hold the potential to greatly
enhance measurements of the MoI of NSs. The MoI measurements of binary pulsars
are pivotal to advancing our understanding of matter at supranuclear densities
as well as improving the precision of gravity tests, such as the orbital decay
due to gravitational wave emission and of tests of alternative gravity
theories.

                                        <span>  We present a new perspective on the symmetries that govern the formation of
large-scale structures across the Universe, particularly focusing on the
transition from the seeds of galaxy clusters to the seeds of galaxies
themselves. We address two main features of cosmological fluid dynamics
pertaining to both the linear and non-linear regimes. The linear dynamics of
cosmological perturbations within the Hubble horizon is characterized by the
Jeans length, which separates stable configurations from unstable fluctuations
due to the gravitational effect on sufficiently large (and therefore, massive
enough) overdensities. On the other hand, the non-linear dynamics of the
cosmological fluid is associated with a turbulent behavior once the Reynolds
numbers reach a sufficiently high level. This turbulent regime leads to energy
dissipation across smaller and smaller scales, resulting in a fractal
distribution of eddies throughout physical space. The proposed scenario
suggests that the spatial scale of eddy formation is associated with the Jeans
length of various levels of fragmentation from an original large-scale
structure. By focusing on the fragmentation of galaxy cluster seeds versus
galaxy seeds, we arrived at a phenomenological law that links the ratio of the
two structure densities to the number of galaxies in each cluster and to the
Hausdorff number of the Universe matter distribution. Finally, we introduced a
primordial magnetic field and studied its influence on the Jeans length
dynamics. The resulting anisotropic behavior of the density contrast led us to
infer that the main features of the turbulence could be reduced to a 2D Euler
equation. Numerical simulations showed that the two lowest wavenumbers
contained the major energy contribution of the spectrum.

the Mass-Radius relations of Neutron Stars induced by the presence of the
Quintessence field. We consider, in particular, the Kiselev model, according to
which the Quintessence field, being present in the entire Universe, might also
be present around massive objects. Considering the Equation of State (EoS) for
Baryonic matter BSk22 derived by A. Y. Potekhin et al., we infer the upper
limit for NS masses in the presence of Quintessence. The presence of
Quintessence generates a peculiar effect for which the Mass-Radius relation is
unvaried and therefore the presence of Quintessence is indistinguishable from
ordinary matter, at least for the Kiselev model studied in this paper.

$f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs). We consider hadronic
matter modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model based on
the neutron decay anomaly. We study the non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for
such DM admixed NS in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the
impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode
characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode
parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model
parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation
for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction
strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters and NS
observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode
universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the
existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.

                                        <span>  Weak-signal limit is often used in estimating stochastic gravitational-wave
background (SGWB) intensities. This approximation fails and the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) can be much weaker when background signals are loud compared to the
detector noise. In this work, we highlight this limitation for the SGWB
detection using space-borne detector networks. For the TianQin + LISA network,
the SNR estimated under the weak-signal limit might be off by as large as an
order of magnitude. Contour plots of SNR over the parameter spaces are also
presented to indicate regions susceptible to this discrepancy. Our results
suggest that DA and DB type extragalactic double white dwarfs may yield an SGWB
with SNR surpassing 100 after 1 year of operation in the weak-signal-limit
scenario, with a redshift-independent merger rate of about $500\,\,{\rm
Mpc^{-3}\,Myr^{-1}}$. In fact, this value falls significantly below the
necessary threshold. Similar influences arise for first-order phase
transitions, yet pinning down parameter regions remains formidable due to model
uncertainties.

                                        <span>  We study the degrees of freedom of the Proca theory, non-minimally coupled to
gravity. In the Minkowski background, this theory propagates five degrees of
freedom - a massive longitudinal mode, two massive vector ones, and two
massless tensor modes. At first sight, the non-linear coupling between the
metric perturbations and the vector field indicates that both longitudinal and
tensor modes become strongly coupled, at the same scale. This would imply that
no matter how small the photon mass is if non-minimal coupling is taken into
account, gravitational waves would necessarily be strongly coupled. We show
that the way out of this inconsistency is through the introduction of the
disformal coupling to the metric perturbations that resemble the vector-type
disformal transformations. This way, the unphysical coupling between the two
types of modes can be avoided, rendering the model consistent. As a result, we
show that only the longitudinal modes enter a strong coupling regime, while
both tensor and transverse modes remain weakly coupled at all scales up to the
Planck length. Finally, we show how this cures recently reported runaway modes
in curved spacetime.

                                        <span>  The promise of multi-messenger astronomy relies on the rapid detection of
gravitational waves at very low latencies ($\mathcal{O}$(1\,s)) in order to
maximize the amount of time available for follow-up observations. In recent
years, neural-networks have demonstrated robust non-linear modeling
capabilities and millisecond-scale inference at a comparatively small
computational footprint, making them an attractive family of algorithms in this
context. However, integration of these algorithms into the gravitational-wave
astrophysics research ecosystem has proven non-trivial. Here, we present the
first fully machine learning-based pipeline for the detection of gravitational
waves from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) running in low-latency. We
demonstrate this pipeline to have a fraction of the latency of traditional
matched filtering search pipelines while achieving state-of-the-art sensitivity
to higher-mass stellar binary black holes.

distribution of the helicity of radiative gravitons and it may be tested by
gravitational wave experiments in the future. We derive a quadrupole formula
for the helicity flux density due to gravitational radiation in the slow motion
and the weak field limit. We apply the formula to the bound and unbound orbits
in two-body systems and find that the total radiative helicity fluxes are
always zero. However, the helicity flux density still has non-trivial
dependence on the angle. We also find a formula for the total helicity flux by
including all contributions of the higher multipoles.

                                        <span>  High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic
scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive
signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of
researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through
graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include
the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the
cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and
planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario,
we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact
objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window.
Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and
quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of
the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent
literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the
stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity
at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is
dominated by coherent binary mergers.

                                        <span>  Recently, scholars such as Lewandowski, Ma, and Yang have successfully
derived a quantum-corrected black hole model in loop quantum gravity
(Phys.Rev.Lett.130.101501 (2023)), which is a modification of the Schwarzschild
black hole. In this paper, we calculate the strong/weak gravitational lensing
effects under the quantum-corrected black hole model, taking the supermassive
black holes M87* and SgrA* as the subjects of study to explore the impact of
the quantum correction parameter $\alpha$ on the positions of images and the
Einstein ring. Our calculations show that in the case of strong gravitational
lensing, the lensing coefficient $\bar{a}$ increases with an increase in the
quantum correction parameter, while the deflection angle and the lensing
coefficient $\bar{b}$ decrease with an increase in the quantum correction
parameter. The quantum correction parameter $\alpha$ has a significant impact
in the context of supermassive black holes. In weak gravitational lensing, the
quantum correction parameter $\alpha$ plays a suppressive role. Our theoretical
analysis suggests that with advancements in future astrophysical observation
techniques, it might be possible to test loop quantum gravity theory using the
gravitational lensing effect.

supermassive black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity by using the
Novikov-Thorne model. Our exploration focuses on understanding the impact of
the model parameter on various physical properties of the disk. The results
reveal that as the dilaton parameter $r_2$ increases, the energy flux,
radiation temperature, spectra luminosity, and conversion efficiency of the
disk all increase. By narrowing down the dilaton parameter range to $0\leqslant
r_2\leqslant0.4$ M, we discover that in the high-frequency region, the Kerr-Sen
black hole demonstrates higher energy output compared to the Kerr black hole.
This facilitates a more straightforward examination of the observational
results for two black holes.

                                        <span>  Using the exact solution that describes multi-centered rotating black holes,
recently discovered by Teo and Wan, we investigate the innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO) for massive particles and the circular orbit for massless
particles moving around a spinning black hole binary. We assume equal masses
$M_1 = M_2=m$ and equal spin angular momenta $|J_1| = |J_2|$ for both black
holes. Firstly, we examine the case where two black holes are spinning in the
same direction ($J_1=J_2$). We clarify that that for particles rotating in the
same direction as (opposite directions to) black holes' spin, the greater the
spin angular momenta of the black holes, the more the radii of the ISCO for
massive particles and the circular orbit for massless particles decrease
(increase). We show that distinct ISCO transitions occur for particles rotating
in the same direction as the black holes in three ranges of spin angular
momenta: $0<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2< 0.395...$, $0.395...<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2< 0.483...$,
and $0.483...<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2<0.5$. Conversely, particles rotating in the
opposite direction to the black holes exhibit a consistent transition pattern
for the case $0<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2<0.5$. Secondly, we study the situation where
binary black holes are spinning in opposite directions ($J_1=-J_2$). We clarify
that for large (small) separations between black holes, the ISCO appears near
the black hole that is spinning in the same (opposite) direction as particles'
rotation. Additionally, we show that different ISCO transitions occur in the
three angular momentum ranges: $0<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2< 0.160...$,
$0.160...<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2< 0.467...$, and $0.467...<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2<0.5$.

universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain
elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly interacting massive
particles, which may aggregate into steep concentrations around the central
black holes of galaxies, forming dense spikes. Employing Schwarzschild
geometry, we assess the density and velocity distribution of DM within such
spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we
identify universal features in the density profile of DM and fit them with
Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dynamical
friction on gravitational waves (GWs) generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals
(EMRIs) within DM spikes. Our findings uncover phase shifts in the time-domain
waveform, potentially providing significant insights for the GW-based detection
of DM in galactic centers.

                                        <span>  The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a
Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd
as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an
operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via
appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the
canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part
of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain
the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the
pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons
initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher
information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the
gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the
bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For
a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound
of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude
measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term
approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next
consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over
time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the
square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced
by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which
it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the
Bose-Einstein condensate which results in a decoherence. We observe that the
decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.

                                        <span>  In this work, we explore the inflationary dynamics induced by small
fluctuations on the Skyrme brane, characterized by a time-dependent
perturbative function $\tilde{\phi}$. In the low-energy regime, the model
successfully reproduces standard inflation, with a potential term dictated by
the Skyrmion at the brane. Gravity localization is achieved at the brane, and
the lowest energy scale is established at the asymptotic boundary. The model
demonstrates the capability to emulate standard inflation dynamics, resembling
$\tilde{\phi}^4$ potential characteristics under certain conditions. At higher
energy levels, the behaviour of $\tilde{\phi}$ is contingent upon the Skyrme
term coupling constant $\lambda$, influencing reheating phases. The wave-like
nature of fluctuations allows for energy transfer, resulting in a possibly
lower reheating temperature. We also discuss the prospect of $\lambda$ changing
sign during inflation, presenting a non-standard coupling dependent on the
matter field.

                                        <span>  The cosmological event horizons are observer-dependent, which might bring a
paradox. As an example, in dS$_{2}$ multiverse model there are entanglement
islands in crunching regions encoding the information of regions near future
infinity of inflating or Minkowski bubbles, however, for two observers in
different bubbles, since their island regions overlap, both observers will be
able to get access to the information encoded in the overlapping region,
indicating a violation of no-cloning theorem. In this paper, we present a
different resolution to this paradox. Based on the Petz
$\mathrm{R\acute{e}nyi}$ mutual information, we show that besides the quantum
extremal surfaces there might be another boundary for the island in
corresponding spacetime so that the island regions are bounded by ``division
points" rather than extending to the rest of the entire spacetime. We also
discuss the implications of our result.

Hamiltonian is the position operator of the Harmonic oscillator. This model
captures the high temperature limit of DSSYK but could also be defined as a
quantum theory in its own right. We study properties of the emergent geometry
including its dynamics in response to inserting matter particles. In
particular, we find that the model displays de Sitter-like properties such as
that infalling matter reduces the rate of growth of geodesic slices between the
two boundaries. The simplicity of the model allows us to compute the full
generating functional for correlation functions of the length mode or any
number of matter operators. We provide evidence that the effective action of
the geodesic length between boundary points is non-local. Furthermore, we use
the on-shell solution for the geodesic lengths between any two boundary points
to reconstruct an effective bulk metric and reverse engineer the dilaton
gravity theory that generates this metric as a solution.

                                        <span>  Loop quantum cosmology is a symmetry-reduced application of loop quantum
gravity. The theory predicts a bounce for the universe at the Planck scale and
resolves the singularity of standard cosmology. The dynamics is also governed
by an effective Hamiltonian, which predicts a modified Friedmann equation
containing the quadratic terms of the energy density. The term plays an
essential role in the high energy regime, but the equations return to the
standard form in the low energy regime. The evolution of the universe in the
pre-inflationary period is studied in the framework of loop quantum cosmology,
where the DBI scalar field is assumed to be the dominant component of the
universe. Using the numerical method, we provide the evolution of the DBI
field. The background evolution shows that there are three phases as: bouncing
phase, transition phase and slow-roll inflationary phase. There is also a short
period of super-inflation just at the beginning of the bounce phase. The field
first climbs the potential and then reaches the turning point where
$\dot{\phi}$ disappears and the potential energy becomes the dominant part of
the energy density. This is the time when the slow roll inflation begins and
the field slowly rolls down the potential. The results indicate that there are
a few e-fold expansions in the bounce phase, about $N = $, and the universe
experiences about $N = 59$ e-fold expansions in the slow-roll inflation phase.

galaxy bispectrum, investigations of the post-reconstruction bispectrum are
still in nascent stages. In this paper, we present a bispectrum model that
incorporates one-loop corrections in the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT),
while simultaneously addressing infrared (IR) effects in the
post-reconstruction density fluctuations in a non-perturbative approach. This
model accurately captures the nonlinear behavior of the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) signal within the post-reconstruction bispectrum framework.
Furthermore, the incorporation of the one-loop correction extends its
applicability to smaller scales. Given that the approach to addressing IR
effects remains invariant before and after the reconstruction process, the
resulting IR-resummed bispectrum model exhibits uniformity across both
scenarios. Throughout this analysis, we achieve a comprehensive and unified
description of the bispectrum that seamlessly spans the pre- and
post-reconstruction phases. An explanatory video is available at

                                        <span>  We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$
right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family
of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and
only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the
energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories
along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T
\overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the
deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N =
\overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T
\overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical
background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds
with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual
$U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to
describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall
systems.

dimension of the internal (spin) space is $n=5$, instead of the conventional
dimension $n=4$. Then extending the usual $4\times 4$ tetrads (vierbein),
gravity is described in terms of the 5-bein (f\"unfbein or five legs). We
discuss the properties of the spacetime geometry induced from this 5-leg Dirac
spinor theory, where the spin connection contains $10\times 4=40$ elements
instead of 24 elements in the tetrad formulation of the general relativity

                                        <span>  Chameleon dark energy models are a popular alternative to the standard
cosmological constant model. These models consist of a new light degree of
freedom, called chameleon, with a density dependent mass and a non-trivial
coupling to both matter and photons. Owing to these couplings, chameleons can
be produced inside the sun. However due to their density dependent mass, the
chameleons produced in the solar core are screened and cannot escape whereas
those produced outside the solar core, such as in the \textit{tachocline}
region with energies of the order of few a keV, can escape from the sun and
travel all the way towards Earth. Hence the Earth is expected to receive a flux
of \textit{solar chameleons}. In this work we propose a \textit{light shining
through wall} (LSW) type of experiment in which the Earth itself acts as a
wall. Both photons and chameleons are incident on the light side of the Earth.
While all the photons are stopped by the Earth, only a fraction of the
chameleons are stopped by the earth due to screening. Those chameleons which
are not screened by the earth pass directly through the Earth and exit the
night side. Here these chameleons interact with the geomagnetic field and
convert into X-ray photons. A space based X-ray telescope orbiting the Earth
can detect these X-ray photons, while passing through the night side, thereby
acting as a detector in this LSW type experiment. We show that such a kind of
setup can be complementary to other terrestrial experiments looking for
chameleons.

                                        <span>  In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a
black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a
generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field
Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned
observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of
impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field
massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit.
We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as
massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation
integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some
analytical results using stationary phase approximation. Interestingly, we also
show that the $\lambda_4 \varphi^4$ interaction vertex does not contribute to
the radiation by showing that the integral has no non-zero finite value.

                                        <span>  We study the evolution of abelian $U(1)$ electromagnetic as well as
non-abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields, in the presence of space-time oscillations.
Analysis of the time evolution of abelian gauge fields shows the presence of
parametric resonance in spatial modes. A similar analysis in the case of
non-abelian gauge fields, in the linear approximation, shows the presence of
the same resonant spatial modes. The resonant modes induce large fluctuations
in physical observables including those that break the $CP-$symmetry. We also
carry out time evolution of small random fluctuations of the gauge fields,
using numerical simulations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. These simulations
help to study non-linear effects in the case of non-abelian gauge theories. Our
results show that there is an increase in energy density with the coupling, at
late times. These results suggest that gravitational waves may excite
non-abelian gauge fields more efficiently than electromagnetic fields. Also,
gravitational waves in the early Universe and from the merger of neutron stars,
black holes etc. may enhance $CP-$violation and generate an imbalance in chiral
charge distributions, magnetic fields etc.

                                        <span>  We present results of a follow-up search for continuous gravitational waves
(CWs) associated with sub-threshold candidates from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)
All-Sky All-Frequency (ASAF) directed radiometer analysis, using Advanced LIGO
data from the third observing run (O3). Each ASAF candidate corresponds to a
$1/32\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$ frequency band and ${\sim}13\,\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ sky
pixel. Assuming they represent possible CW sources, we analyze all $515$ ASAF
candidates using a semi-coherent, $\mathcal{F}$-statistic-based matched filter
search. The search algorithm incorporates a hidden Markov model (HMM),
expanding the signal model to allow frequency spin-wandering, as well as
unmodeled frequency evolution of less than $10^{-5}$ Hz per day that is not
captured by the searched range of $\pm10^{-9}\,\,\mathrm{Hz/s}$ in frequency
derivative. Significance thresholds with a $5\%$ probability of false alarm per
ASAF candidate are determined empirically by searching detector noise at
various off-target sky positions. We obtain $14$ outliers surviving a set of
vetoes designed to eliminate instrumental artifacts. Upon further
investigation, these outliers are deemed unlikely to represent astrophysical
signals. We estimate the sensitivity of our search to both isolated and binary
sources with orbital period greater than one year by recovering simulated
signals added to detector data. The minimum detectable strain amplitude at
$95\%$ confidence for isolated (long-period binary) sources is $h_0^{95\%} =
8.8\times 10^{-26}$ ($9.4\times 10^{-26}$) at a frequency of
$222.6\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$. While this study focuses on ASAF sub-threshold
candidates, the method presented could be applied to follow up candidates from
future all-sky CW searches, complementing currently existing methods.

                                        <span>  We use the Jordan frame-Einstein frame correspondence to explore dual
universes with contrasting cosmological evolutions. We study the mapping
between Einstein and Jordan frames where the Einstein frame universe describes
the late-time evolution of the physical universe, which is driven by dark
energy and non-relativistic matter. The Brans-Dicke theory of gravity is
considered to be the dual scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame. We show
that an Einstein frame universe, with cosmological evolution of the
$\Lambda$CDM model, always corresponds to a bouncing Jordan frame universe
governed by a Brans-Dicke theory. On the other hand, quintessence models of
dark energy with non-relativistic matter component are shown to be always dual
to a Brans-Dicke Jordan frame with a turn-around, i.e., a bounce or a collapse.
The evolution of the equation of state of the quintessence field determines
whether the turn-around is a bounce or a collapse. The point of the Jordan
frame turn-around for all the cases can be tuned anywhere by choosing an
appropriate Brans-Dicke parameter. This essentially leads to alternative
descriptions of the late-time evolution of the physical universe, in terms of
bouncing or collapsing Brans-Dicke universes in the Jordan frame. Therefore,the
effect of dark energy can equivalently be seen as collapse of space in a
conformally connected universe. We further study the stability of such
conformal maps against linear perturbations. The effective bouncing and
collapsing descriptions of the current accelerating universe may have
interesting implications for the evolutions of perturbations and quantum
fluctuations in the cosmological background.

                                        <span>  Recent gravitational wave detections from black hole mergers have underscored
the critical role black hole perturbation theory and the Teukolsky equation
play in understanding the behaviour of black holes. The separable nature of the
Teukolsky equation has long been leveraged to study the vacuum linear Teukolsky
equation; however, as theory and measurements advance, solving the sourced
Teukolsky equation is becoming a frontier of research. In particular,
second-order calculations, such as in quasi-normal mode and self-force
problems, have extended sources. This paper presents a novel method for
analytically separating the Teukolsky equation's source, aimed to improve
efficiency. Separating the source is a non-trivial problem due to the angular
and radial mixing of generic quantities in Kerr spacetime. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration of our method and show that it is accurate,
separating the Teukolsky source produced by the stress-energy tensor of an
ideal gas cloud surrounding a Kerr black hole. The detailed application of our
method is provided in an accompanying \textit{Mathematica} notebook. Our
approach opens up a new avenue for accurate black hole perturbation theory
calculations with sources in both the time and frequency domain.

under the conformal motion treatment within the context of f(Q) gravity. We
have developed two models by implementing the power-law and linear form of
conformal factor, enabling an in-depth comparison in our study. We have
selected the MIT Bag model equation of state to describe the connection between
pressure and energy density and matched the interior spherically symmetric
space-time with the Bardeen space-time. In addition, the present research
examines various physically valid characteristics of realistic stars, such as
PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and SMC X-1. We compare two
constructed models by attributing the behavior of density, pressure,
equilibrium conditions, and the adiabatic index. We have additionally included
a brief analysis of the scenario involving Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as an
external geometry for the matching condition. In contrast to the
Reissner-Nordstrom instance, the Bardeen model with the extra term in the
asymptotic representations yields a more intriguing and viable result. The
current analysis reveals that the resulting compact star solutions are
physically acceptable and authentic when considering the presence of charge
with conformal motion in f(Q) gravity.

                                        <span>  Rotating fermion-boson stars are hypothetical celestial objects that consist
of both fermionic and bosonic matter interacting exclusively through gravity.
Bosonic fields are believed to arise in certain models of particle physics
describing dark matter and could accumulate within neutron stars, modifying
some of their properties and gravitational wave emission. Fermion-boson stars
have been extensively studied in the static non-rotating case, exploring their
combined stability and their gravitational radiation in binary mergers.
However, stationary rotating configurations were yet to be found and
investigated. The presence of a bosonic component could impact the development
of the bar-mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars.
Therefore, the study of rotating fermion-boson stars has important implications
for astrophysics, as they could provide a new avenue for the detection of
gravitational waves. In addition, these objects may shed light on the behavior
of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the cores of neutron
stars, and explain any tension in the determination of the dense-matter
equation of state from multi-messenger observations. In this work we study a
new consistent method of constructing uniformly rotating fermion-boson stars
and we analyse some of their main properties. These objects might offer
alternative explanations for current observations populating the lower
black-hole mass gap, as the $2.6 M_\odot$ compact object involved in GW190814.

                                        <span>  In cosmological $N$-body simulations of warm dark matter, thermal velocities
of dark-matter particles are sometimes taken into account by adding random
initial velocities to the particles of simulation. However, a particle in the
$N$-body system represents a huge collection of dark-matter particles, whose
average thermal velocity is very close to zero. We consider justification of
the procedure of adding thermal velocities in $N$-body simulations and build a
simple model of their influence on the power spectrum. Our model captures the
physical effect of suppression of the power spectrum at small wave numbers and
also explains its artificial enhancement at large wave numbers, observed in
numerical simulations with added thermal velocities. The cause of this
enhancement is the disturbance of the growth rate of the density profile
introduced when adding random initial thermal velocities. Specifically, the
model predicts a turnover in the behavior of the simulated power spectrum at a
certain wave number $k_*$, beyond which it grows as $P (k) \propto k^2$. Our
treatment is generalized to a system consisting of several matter components
with different thermal velocity dispersion. We also estimate the effects of
discreteness related to the bulk velocity field and establish the conditions
under which these effects dominate over those of thermal velocities.

pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the
interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to
provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on
the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the
system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's
principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement,
as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the
initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the
cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero,
and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the
Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal
state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal
pure quantum (CTPQ) state.

where classical black hole horizons used to appear in Einstein's classical
theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the
internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS)
spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase
space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong
that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist
at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric
coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the
corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces
always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such
surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically
complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.

unidirectional electromagnetic field interacting with a scalar field. We
consider the minimal interaction and the non-minimal interaction by the law

theory. Using the reconstruction method, we build models in which the
anisotropic level tends to a small value as the Universe expands. One of the
results is a model with a anisotropic bounce.

a regime with negative bosonic wave function renormalization -- using lattice
field theory. For negative bare wave function renormalization, inhomogeneous
condensates are solutions of the classical equations of motions. Using hybrid
Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate how bosonic quantum fluctuations
disorder the inhomogeneous condensate. Instead, one finds a so-called Quantum

$\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$, can serve as a magnetometer of QCD. This is demonstrated
by lattice QCD computations using the highly improved staggered quarks with
physical pion mass of $M_\pi=135~$MeV on $N_\tau=8$ and 12 lattices. We find
that $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$ along the transition line starts to increase rapidly
with magnetic field strength $eB\gtrsim 2M_\pi^2$ and by a factor 2 at
$eB\simeq 8M_\pi^2$. Furthermore, the ratio of electric charge chemical
potential to baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$, shows
significant dependence on the magnetic field strength and varies from the ratio
of electric charge to baryon number in the colliding nuclei in heavy ion
collisions. These results can provide baselines for effective theory and model
studies, and both $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$ and $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ could be
useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion
collision experiments as compared with corresponding results from the hadron
resonance gas model.

                                        <span>  This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants,
with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space.
The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on
models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic
compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the
galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction
with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in
effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave
signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a
phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects
using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo
satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental
constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite
clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event.
Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum
reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery
range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We
investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$
kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient
effects, has never been explored previously.

                                        <span>  The transport properties of strongly interacting fermionic systems can reveal
exotic states of matter, but experiments and theory have predominantly focused
on bulk systems in the hydrodynamic limit describable with linear response
coefficients such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In a ballistic
channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs, recent experiments revealed a
far-from-equilibrium regime beyond linear hydrodynamics where particle and
entropy currents respond nonlinearly to biases of chemical potential and
temperature, and their ratio is robust to the channel geometry. However, the
origin of this robustness and its relation to the strong interparticle
interactions remain unknown. Here, we study the coupled transport of particles
and entropy tuning the interaction across the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer to
Bose-Einstein condensate (BCS-BEC) crossover, the reservoir degeneracy across
the superfluid phase transition, as well as the local potentials and
confinement of the channel. Surprisingly, the entropy advectively transported
per particle depends only on the interactions and reservoir degeneracy and not
on the details of the channel, suggesting that this property has its origin in
the universal equilibrium properties of the reservoirs. In contrast, the
magnitudes of the advective and diffusive entropy currents vary significantly
with the channel details. The advective current increases monotonically towards
the BEC side, which can be largely explained by the estimated superfluid gap in
the channel. The Wiedemann-Franz law that links the advective and diffusive
currents in Fermi liquids is most egregiously violated at unitarity, suggesting
a change in the nature of the excitations responsible for entropy diffusion
near unitarity. These observations pose fundamental questions regarding
transport phenomena in strongly interacting Fermi systems far from equilibrium.

                                        <span>  Coulomb excitation of hydrogen atoms by vortex protons is theoretically
investigated within the framework of the non--relativistic first--Born
approximation and the density matrix approach. Special attention is paid to the
magnetic sublevel population of excited atoms and, consequently, to the angular
distribution of the fluorescence radiation. We argue that both these properties
are sensitive to the projection of the orbital angular momentum (OAM), carried
by the projectile ions. In order to illustrate the OAM--effect, detailed
calculations have been performed for the $1s \to 2p$ excitation and the
subsequent $2p \to 1s$ radiative decay of a hydrogen target, interacting with
incident Laguerre--Gaussian vortex protons. The calculation results suggest
that Coulomb excitation can be employed for the diagnostics of vortex ion beam
at accelerator and storage ring facilities.

                                        <span>  We introduce and demonstrate a hybrid optically pumped magnetometer (HOPM)
that simultaneously measures one dc field component and one rf field component
quadrature with a single atomic spin ensemble. The HOPM achieves
sub-pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity for both dc and rf fields, and is
limited in sensitivity by spin projection noise at low frequencies and by
photon shot noise at high frequencies. We demonstrate with the HOPM a new
application of multiparameter quantum sensing: background-cancelling spread
spectrum magnetic communication. We encode a digital message as rf amplitude,
spread among sixteen channels from \SI{29}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{33}{\kilo\hertz}
in a noisy magnetic environment, and observe quantum-noise-limited rf magnetic
signal recovery enabled by quantum-noise-limited dc noise cancellation,
reaching noise rejection of \SI{15}{\decibel} at \SI{100}{\hertz} and more than
\SI{20}{\decibel} at \SI{60}{\hertz} and below. We measure signal fidelity
versus signal strength and extrinsic noise in communication of a short text
message. The combination of high sensitivity, quantum-noise-limited
performance, and real-world application potential makes the HOPM ideally suited
for study of high-performance multiparameter quantum sensing.

$^1$S$_0$ - 5d6p $^3$D$^\text{o}_1$ 413nm electric quadrupole transition, which
is utilized for efficient barium ion trapping via photoionization using a
single coherent light source. The measured isotope shifts relative to
$^{138}$Ba are $392.5\pm0.6$ MHz, $177.8\pm0.4$ MHz, $400.6\pm1.0$ MHz, and
$125.9\pm1.4$ MHz for isotopes with atomic number 137, 136, 135 and 134,
respectively. We verified the measured isotopes with King plot analysis and
compared the result with the formerly known shifts inferred from previous
studies on neighboring transitions. The results could be used for efficient
isotope selective loading of low-abundant barium ions, while careful
suppression of line broadening is required for successful isotopic selectivity.

system in free-fall around a gravitating body {\it e.g.} a satellite orbiting
the Earth. Since the system is in free-fall, by the equivalence principle, the
quantum system is locally in flat, gravity-free space-time - it is screened
from the gravitational field. For a slightly elliptical orbit, the
gravitational potential will change with time. This leads to the energy levels
of the quantum system developing side bands which is the signature for this
version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This contrasts with the normal signature
of the Aharonov-Bohm effect of shifting of interference fringes.

photonic links into modular quantum computers. We present an ion trap system

                                        <span>  The conventional wisdom suggests that transports of conserved quantities in
non-integrable quantum many-body systems at high temperatures are diffusive.
However, we discover a counterexample of this paradigm by uncovering anomalous
hydrodynamics in a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with power-law couplings. This model,
classified as non-integrable due to its Wigner-Dyson level-spacing statistics
in the random matrix theory, exhibits a surprising
superdiffusive-ballistic-superdiffusive transport transition by varying the
power-law exponent of couplings for a fixed anisotropy. Our findings are
verified by multiple observables, including the spin-spin autocorrelator,
mean-square displacement, and spin conductivity. Interestingly, we further
quantify the degree of quantum chaos using the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the entanglement entropy distributions of the model's eigenstates and a
random state. Remarkably, an observed local maximum in the divergence near the
transition boundary suggests a link between anomalous hydrodynamics and a
suppression of quantum chaos. This work offers another deep understanding of
emergent anomalous transport phenomena in a wider range of non-integrable
quantum many-body systems

                                        <span>  Quantum hypothesis testing has been traditionally studied from the
information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal
decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an
unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of quantum
hypothesis testing, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of
samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the
wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on quantum hypothesis
testing, we characterize the sample complexity of binary quantum hypothesis
testing in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the
sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing. In more detail, we
prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing
depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the
negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's
lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary quantum
hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse type~II error
probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. Finally, we provide
lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis
testing, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we analyze the harmonically driven Jaynes-Cummings and
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models using both numerical integration of time-dependent
Hamiltonians and Floquet theory. For a separation of time-scales between the
drive and intrinsic Rabi oscillations in the former model, the driving results
in an effective periodic reversal of time. The corresponding Floquet Hamilto-
nian is a Wannier-Stark model, which can be analytically solved. Despite the
chaotic nature of the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, moderate system sizes
can display qualitatively different behaviors under varying system parameters.
Ergodicity arises in systems that are neither adiabatic nor diabatic, owing to
repeated multi-level Landau-Zener transitions. Chaotic behavior, observed in
slow driving, manifests as random jumps in the magnetization, suggesting
potential utility as a random number generator. Furthermore, we discuss both
models in terms of what we call Floquet Fock state lattices.

                                        <span>  Floquet (periodically driven) systems can give rise to unique non-equilibrium
phases of matter without equilibrium analogs. The most prominent example is the
realization of discrete time crystals. An intriguing question emerges: what
other novel phases can manifest when the constraint of time periodicity is
relaxed? In this study, we explore quantum systems subjected to a
quasi-periodic drive. Leveraging a strongly interacting spin ensemble in
diamond, we identify the emergence of long-lived discrete time quasi-crystals.
Unlike conventional time crystals, time quasi-crystals exhibit robust
sub-harmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies. Furthermore, we
show that the multi-frequency nature of the quasi-periodic drive allows for the
formation of diverse patterns associated with different discrete time
quasi-crystalline phases. Our findings demonstrate the existence of
non-equilibrium phases in quasi-Floquet settings, significantly broadening the
catalog of novel phenomena in driven many-body quantum systems.

                                        <span>  In detuned optical cavities, the radiation pressure force acting on the
mirrors depends on their displacements. This is equivalent to the rigidity (the
optical spring), inserted between the mirrors. This effect can be used for
optimization of the mechanical susceptibility of probe mirrors in
high-precision force sensors. However, in some cases, the use of detuned
cavities or even just any high-finesse cavities could be problematic due to
technological constraints.
  We consider a new type of the optical spring that does not require the cavity
(but can use a resonance tuned one to increase the optomechanical coupling).
Instead, it uses the double interaction of the probing light with the
mechanical object. We propose two possible implementation of this concept,
suitable, respectively, for the atomic spin ensembles and for the laser
gravitational-wave detectors.

discovering the optimal Fermion-to-qubit encoding for targeted Fermionic
Hamiltonians. Fermion-to-qubit encoding is a crucial step in harnessing quantum
computing for efficient simulation of Fermionic quantum systems. Utilizing
Pauli algebra, Fermihedral redefines complex constraints and objectives of
Fermion-to-qubit encoding into a Boolean Satisfiability problem which can then
be solved with high-performance solvers. To accommodate larger-scale scenarios,
this paper proposed two new strategies that yield approximate optimal solutions
mitigating the overhead from the exponentially large number of clauses.
Evaluation across diverse Fermionic systems highlights the superiority of
Fermihedral, showcasing substantial reductions in implementation costs, gate
counts, and circuit depth in the compiled circuits. Real-system experiments on
IonQ's device affirm its effectiveness, notably enhancing simulation accuracy.

                                        <span>  Low-frequency qubit control wires require non-trivial thermal anchoring and
low-pass filtering. The resulting electron temperature serves as a quality
benchmark for these signal lines. In this technical note, we make use of a
primary electron thermometry technique, using a Coulomb blockade thermometer,
to establish the electron temperature in the millikelvin regime. The
experimental four-probe measurement setup, the data analysis, and the
measurement limitations are discussed in detail. We verify the results by also
using another electron thermometry technique, based on a
superconductor-insulator-normal metal junction. Our comparison of signal lines
with QDevil's QFilter to unfiltered signal lines demonstrates that the filter
significantly reduces both the rms noise and electron temperature, which is
measured to be 22 $\pm$ 1 mK.

                                        <span>  Quantum computing provides a powerful framework for tackling computational
problems that are classically intractable. The goal of this paper is to explore
the use of quantum computers for solving relevant problems in systems and
control theory. In the recent literature, different quantum algorithms have
been developed to tackle binary optimization, which plays an important role in
various control-theoretic problems. As a prototypical example, we consider the
verification of interval matrix properties such as non-singularity and
stability on a quantum computer. We present a quantum algorithm solving these
problems and we study its performance in simulation. Our results demonstrate
that quantum computers provide a promising tool for control whose applicability
to further computationally complex problems remains to be explored.

                                        <span>  Quantum Inspire has taken important steps to enable quantum applications by
developing a setting that allows the execution of hybrid algorithms. Currently,
the setting uses a classical server (HPC node) co-located with the quantum
computer for the high frequency coupling needed by hybrid algorithms. A fast
task manager (dispatcher) has been developed to orchestrate the interaction
between the server and the quantum computer. Although successful, the setting
imposes a specific hybrid job-structure. This is most likely always going to be
the case and we are currently discussing how to make sure this does not hamper
the uptake of the setting. Furthermore, first steps have been taken towards the
integration with the Dutch National High-Performance Computing (HPC) Center,
hosted by SURF. As a first approach we have setup a setting consisting of two
SLURM clusters, one in the HPC (C1) and the second (C2) co-located with Quantum
Inspire API. Jobs are submitted from C1 to C2. Quantum Inspire can then
schedule with C2 the jobs to the quantum computer. With this setting, we enable
control from both SURF and Quantum Inspire on the jobs being executed. By using
C1 for the jobs submission we remove the accounting burden from Quantum
Inspire. By having C2 co-located with Quantum Inspire API, we make the setting
more resilient towards network failures. This setting can be extended for other
HPC centers to submit jobs to Quantum Inspire backends.

                                        <span>  Ultrastrong coupling (USC) in the quantum Rabi model, characterized by the
breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) has become a topic of
considerable interest and study. This critical reevaluation of the validity of
the RWA concludes that the accepted definition of USC in terms of a fixed ratio
of coupling to field frequency is inadequate. Connecting an improved spectral
validity criterion with the derivation of the semiclassical limit predicts that
the dynamical validity of the quantum RWA should be linked to that of the
corresponding semiclassical model. This, however, is not supported by numerical
calculations of coherent-state dynamics, which unambiguously demonstrate that
spectral validity does not imply dynamical validity and reveal surprisingly
complicated dependence on coupling and field amplitude.

thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with
finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs
state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result
implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties
and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries.
Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect
to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence
is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the
Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's
theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in
the bulk.

explored in the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) funded
project "Q-GRID" which aims to assess potential quantum utility optimization
applications in the electrical grid. The project focuses on two layers of
optimization problems relevant to decentralized energy generation and
transmission as well as novel energy transportation/exchange methods such as
Peer-2-Peer energy trading and microgrid formation. For select energy grid
optimization problems, we demonstrate exponential classical optimizer runtime
scaling even for small problem instances, and present initial findings that
variational quantum algorithms such as QAOA and hybrid quantum annealing
solvers may provide more favourable runtime scaling to obtain similar solution
quality. These initial results suggest that quantum computing may be a key
enabling technology in the future energy transition insofar that they may be
able to solve business problems which are already challenging at small problem
instance sizes.

                                        <span>  This paper outlines an alternative approach to teaching quantum computing at
the high school level, tailored for students with limited prior knowledge in
advanced mathematics and physics. This approach diverges from traditional
methods by building upon foundational concepts in classical computing before
gradually introducing quantum mechanics, thereby simplifying the entry into
this complex field. The course was initially implemented in a program for
gifted high school students under the Hong Kong Education Bureau and received
encouraging feedback, indicating its potential effectiveness for a broader
student audience. A key element of this approach is the practical application
through portable NMR quantum computers, which provides students with hands-on
experience. The paper describes the structure of the course, including the
organization of the lectures, the integration of the hardware of the portable
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computers, the Gemini/Triangulum
series, and detailed lecture notes in an appendix. The initial success in the
specialized program and ongoing discussions to expand the course to regular
high schools in Hong Kong and Shenzhen suggest the viability of this approach
for wider educational application. By focusing on accessibility and student
engagement, this approach presents a valuable perspective on introducing
quantum computing concepts at the high school level, aiming to enhance student
understanding and interest in the field.

                                        <span>  Classification is at the core of data-driven prediction and decision-making,
representing a fundamental task in supervised machine learning. Recently,
several quantum machine learning algorithms that use quantum kernels as a
measure of similarities between data have emerged to perform binary
classification on datasets encoded as quantum states. The potential advantages
of quantum kernels arise from the ability of quantum computers to construct
kernels that are more effective than their classical counterparts in capturing
patterns in data or computing kernels more efficiently. However, existing
quantum kernel-based classification algorithms do not harness the capability of
having data samples in quantum superposition for additional enhancements. In
this work, we demonstrate how such capability can be leveraged in quantum
kernelized binary classifiers (QKCs) through Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)
for quadratic speed-up. Additionally, we propose new quantum circuits for the
QKCs in which the number of qubits is reduced by one, and the circuit depth is
reduced linearly with respect to the number of sample data. We verify the
quadratic speed-up over previous methods through numerical simulations on the
Iris dataset.

learning, image processing and other fields. When dealing with massive
high-dimensional data, the performance of classical computer faces severe
challenges due to MvFE involves expensive matrix calculation. To address this
challenge, a quantum-accelerated cross-regression algorithm for MvFE is
proposed. The main contributions are as follows:(1) a quantum version algorithm
for MvFE is proposed for the first time, filling the gap of quantum computing
in the field of MvFE;(2) a quantum algorithm is designed to construct the
block-encoding of the target data matrix, so that the optimal Hamiltonian
simulation technology based on the block-encoding framework can be used to
efficiently realize the quantum simulation of the target data matrix. This
approach reduces the dependence of the algorithm's on simulation errors to
enhance algorithm performance;(3) compared with the classical counterpart
algorithm, the proposed quantum algorithm has a polynomial acceleration in the
number of data points, the dimension of data points and the number of view
data.

violated. We show the violation explicitly by introducing a special example.

optimization algorithm (QAOA) to support detection in a sparse signal
reconstruction algorithm: matching pursuit. The constrained optimization
required in this algorithm is difficult to handle when the size of the problem
is large and constraints are given by unstructured patterns. Our framework
utilizes specially designed structured constraints that are easy to manipulate
and reduce the optimization problem to the solution of an Ising model which can
be found using Ising solvers. In this research, we test the performance of QAOA
for this purpose on a simulator of quantum computer. We observe that our method
can outperform reference classical methods. Our results explore a promising

optimization problems. This method aims to identify an optimal solution by
maximizing the expected value of the objective function. However, due to its
computational complexity, the function cannot be accurately evaluated directly,
hence it is estimated through simulation. Exploiting the enhanced efficiency of
Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) compared to classical Monte Carlo
simulation, it frequently outpaces classical simulation-based optimization,
resulting in notable performance enhancements in various scenarios. In this
work, we make use of a quantum-enhanced algorithm for simulation-based
optimization and apply it to solve a variant of the classical Newsvendor
problem which is known to be NP-hard. Such problems provide the building block
for supply chain management, particularly in inventory management and
procurement optimization under risks and uncertainty

inGRAPE, to optimization for open quantum systems driven by both coherent and
incoherent controls. In the incoherent control approach, the environment serves
as a control together with coherent field, and decoherence rates become
generally time-dependent. For a qubit, explicit analytic expressions for
evolution of the density matrix were obtained by solving a cubic equation via
Cardano method. We discuss applications of incoherent GRAPE method to high
fidelity gate generation for open one- and two-qubit systems and surprising
properties of the underlying control landscapes, forming two groups - smooth
single peak landscapes for Hadamard, C-NOT and C-Z gates, and more complicated
with two peaks for T (or $\pi/8$) gate. For a qutrit, a formulation of the
environment-assisted incoherent control with time-dependent decoherence rates

                                        <span>  We give two upper bounds to the mutual information in arbitrary quantum
estimation strategies. The first is based on some simple Fourier properties of
the estimation apparatus. The second is derived using the first but,
interestingly, depends only on the Fisher information of the parameter, so it
is valid even beyond quantum estimation. We illustrate the usefulness of these
bounds by characterizing the quantum phase estimation algorithm in the presence
of noise. In addition, for the noiseless case, we extend the analysis beyond
applying the bound and we discuss the optimal entangled and adaptive
strategies, clarifying inaccuracies appearing on this topic in the literature.

                                        <span>  Superconducting microwave metamaterials offer enormous potential for quantum
optics and information science, enabling the development of advanced quantum
technologies for sensing and amplification. In the context of circuit quantum
electrodynamics, such metamaterials can be implemented as coupled cavity arrays
(CCAs). In the continuous effort to miniaturize quantum devices for increasing
scalability, minimizing the footprint of CCAs while preserving low disorder
becomes paramount. In this work, we present a compact CCA architecture
leveraging superconducting NbN thin films presenting high kinetic inductance,
which enables high-impedance CCA ($\sim1.5$ k$\Omega$), while reducing the
resonator footprint. We demonstrate its versatility and scalability by
engineering one-dimensional CCAs with up to 100 resonators and exhibiting
multiple bandgaps. Additionally, we quantitatively investigate disorder in the
CCAs using symmetry-protected topological SSH modes, from which we extract a
resonator frequency scattering of $0.22^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\%$. Our platform opens
up exciting new prospects for analog quantum simulations of many-body physics
with ultrastrongly coupled emitters.

                                        <span>  We present a computational method for open-loop minimum-norm control
synthesis for fixed-endpoint transfer of bilinear ensemble systems that are
indexed by two continuously varying parameters. We suppose that one ensemble
parameter scales the homogeneous, linear part of the dynamics, and the second
parameter scales the effect of the applied control inputs on the inhomogeneous,
bilinear dynamics. This class of dynamical systems is motivated by robust
quantum control pulse synthesis, where the ensemble parameters correspond to
uncertainty in the free Hamiltonian and inhomogeneity in the control
Hamiltonian, respectively. Our computational method is based on polynomial
approximation of the ensemble state in parameter space and discretization of
the evolution equations in the time domain using a product of matrix
exponentials corresponding to zero-order hold controls over the time intervals.
The dynamics are successively linearized about control and trajectory iterates
to formulate a sequence of quadratic programs for computing perturbations to
the control that successively improve the objective until the iteration
converges. We use a two-stage computation to first ensure transfer to the
desired terminal state, and then minimize the norm of the control function. The
method is demonstrated for the canonical uniform transfer problem for the Bloch
system that appears in nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as the matter-wave
splitting problem for the Raman-Nath system that appears in ultra-cold atom
interferometry.

simplicial distributions.

                                        <span>  Chaos plays a crucial role in numerous natural phenomena, but its quantum
nature has remained large elusive. One intriguing quantum-chaotic phenomenon is
the scarring of a single-particle wavefunction, where the quantum probability
density is enhanced in the vicinity of a classical periodic orbit. These
quantum scars illustrate the quantum suppression of classical chaos, offering a
unique way to explore the classical-quantum relationship beyond conventional
limits. In this study, we establish an ergodicity theorem for slacking a group
of adjacent eigenstates, revealing the aspect of antiscarring -- the reduction
of probability density along a periodic orbit generating the corresponding
scars. We thereafter apply these two concepts to variational scars in a
disordered quantum well, and finally discuss their broader implications,
suggesting potential experimental approaches to observe this phenomenon.

                                        <span>  Tensor Networks are graph representations of summation expressions in which
vertices represent tensors and edges represent tensor indices or vector spaces.
In this work, we present EinExprs.jl, a Julia package for contraction path
optimization that offers state-of-art optimizers. We propose a representation
of the contraction path of a Tensor Network based on symbolic expressions.
Using this package the user may choose among a collection of different methods
such as Greedy algorithms, or an approach based on the hypergraph partitioning
problem. We benchmark this library with examples obtained from the simulation
of Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), a well known example where Tensor Networks
provide state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  The challenge of understanding quantum measurement persists as a fundamental
issue in modern physics. Particularly, the abrupt and energy-non-conserving
collapse of the wave function appears to contradict classical thermodynamic
laws. The contradiction can be resolved by considering measurement itself to be
an entropy-increasing process, driven by the second law of thermodynamics. This
proposal, dubbed the Measurement-Equilibration Hypothesis, builds on the
Quantum Darwinism framework derived to explain the emergence of the classical
world. Measurement outcomes thus emerge objectively from unitary dynamics via
closed-system equilibration. Working within this framework, we construct the
set of \textit{`objectifying observables'} that best encode the measurement
statistics of a system in an objective manner, and establish a measurement
error bound to quantify the probability an observer will obtain an incorrect
measurement outcome. Using this error bound, we show that the objectifying
observables readily equilibrate on average under the set of Hamiltonians which
preserve the outcome statistics on the measured system. Using a random matrix
model for this set, we numerically determine the measurement error bound,
finding that the error only approaches zero with increasing environment size
when the environment is coarse-grained into so-called observer systems. This
indicates the necessity of coarse-graining an environment for the emergence of
objective measurement outcomes.

                                        <span>  Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system
is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved.
Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The latter, however, assume initial
states which are highly concentrated around a specific energy window and, as
such, cannot account for a large class of states that are of paramount
importance and that are operationally accessible in natural physical settings,
including many experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum
simulation: low-entanglement states. In this work, we prove thermalization of
these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More
specifically, we define a random energy smoothing - motivated by arguments of
unavoidable finite resolution - on local Hamiltonians that lead to local
thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show
that such transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under a
mild condition, the short time dynamics.

                                        <span>  The multiplication of superpositions of numbers is a core operation in many
quantum algorithms. The standard method for multiplication (both classical and
quantum) has a runtime quadratic in the size of the inputs. Quantum circuits
with asymptotically fewer gates have been developed, but generally exhibit
large overheads, especially in the number of ancilla qubits. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for sub-quadratic-time quantum multiplication with
zero ancilla qubits -- the only qubits involved are the input and output
registers themselves. Our algorithm achieves an asymptotic gate count of
$\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon > 0$; with practical choices of
parameters, we expect scalings as low as $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.3})$. Used as a
subroutine in Shor's algorithm, our technique immediately yields a factoring
circuit with $\mathcal{O}(n^{2+\epsilon})$ gates and only $2n +
\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits; to our knowledge, this is by far the best qubit
count of any factoring circuit with a sub-cubic number of gates. Used in
Regev's recent factoring algorithm, the gate count is
$\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5+\epsilon})$. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithm has
the potential to outperform previous proposals at problem sizes relevant in
practice, including yielding the smallest circuits we know of for
classically-verifiable quantum advantage.

Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models using both numerical integration of time-dependent
Hamiltonians and Floquet theory. For a separation of time-scales between the
drive and intrinsic Rabi oscillations in the former model, the driving results
in an effective periodic reversal of time. The corresponding Floquet
Hamiltonian is a Wannier-Stark model, which can be analytically solved. Despite
the chaotic nature of the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, moderate system
sizes can display qualitatively different behaviors under varying system
parameters. Ergodicity arises in systems that are neither adiabatic nor
diabatic, owing to repeated multi-level Landau-Zener transitions. Chaotic
behavior, observed in slow driving, manifests as random jumps in the
magnetization, suggesting potential utility as a random number generator.
Furthermore, we discuss both models in terms of what we call Floquet Fock state
lattices.

that simultaneously measures one dc field component and one rf field component
quadrature with a single atomic spin ensemble. The HOPM achieves
sub-pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity for both dc and rf fields, and is
limited in sensitivity by spin projection noise at low frequencies and by
photon shot noise at high frequencies. We demonstrate with the HOPM a new
application of multiparameter quantum sensing: background-cancelling spread
spectrum magnetic communication. We encode a digital message as rf amplitude,
spread among sixteen channels from \SI{29}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{33}{\kilo\hertz}
in a noisy magnetic environment, and observe quantum-noise-limited rf magnetic
signal recovery enabled by quantum-noise-limited dc noise cancellation,
reaching noise rejection of \SI{15}{\decibel} at \SI{100}{\hertz} and more than
\SI{20}{\decibel} at \SI{60}{\hertz} and below. We measure signal fidelity
versus signal strength and extrinsic noise in communication of a short text
message. The combination of high sensitivity, quantum-noise-limited
performance, and real-world application potential makes the HOPM ideally suited
for study of high-performance multiparameter quantum sensing.

                                        <span>  While quantum computers provide exciting opportunities for information
processing, they currently suffer from noise during computation that is not
fully understood. Incomplete noise models have led to discrepancies between
quantum program success rate (SR) estimates and actual machine outcomes. For
example, the estimated probability of success (ESP) is the state-of-the-art
metric used to gauge quantum program performance. The ESP suffers poor
prediction since it fails to account for the unique combination of circuit
structure, quantum state, and quantum computer properties specific to each
program execution. Thus, an urgent need exists for a systematic approach that
can elucidate various noise impacts and accurately and robustly predict quantum
computer success rates, emphasizing application and device scaling. In this
article, we propose quantum vulnerability analysis (QVA) to systematically
quantify the error impact on quantum applications and address the gap between
current success rate (SR) estimators and real quantum computer results. The QVA
determines the cumulative quantum vulnerability (CQV) of the target quantum
computation, which quantifies the quantum error impact based on the entire
algorithm applied to the target quantum machine. By evaluating the CQV with
well-known benchmarks on three 27-qubit quantum computers, the CQV success
estimation outperforms the estimated probability of success state-of-the-art
prediction technique by achieving on average six times less relative prediction
error, with best cases at 30 times, for benchmarks with a real SR rate above
0.1%. Direct application of QVA has been provided that helps researchers choose
a promising compiling strategy at compile time.

                                        <span>  Quantum walks have been used to develop quantum algorithms since their
inception, and can be seen as an alternative to the usual circuit model;
combining single-particle quantum walks on sparse graphs with two-particle
scattering on a line lattice is sufficient to perform universal quantum
computation. In this work we solve the problem of two- particle scattering on
the line lattice for a family of interactions without translation invariance,
recovering the Bose-Hubbard interaction as the limiting case. Due to its
generality, our systematic approach lays the groundwork to solve the more
general problem of multi-particle scattering on general graphs, which in turn
can enable design of different or simpler quantum gates and gadgets. As a
consequence of this work, we show that a CPHASE gate can be achieved with high
fidelity when the interaction acts only on a small portion of the line graph.

                                        <span>  The crossover from quantum to semiclassical behavior in the seminal Rabi
model of light-matter interaction still, surprisingly, lacks a complete and
rigorous understanding. A formalism for deriving the semiclassical model
directly from the quantum Hamiltonian is developed here. Working in a displaced
Fock-state basis $\lvert \alpha, n \rangle$, the semiclassical limit is
obtained by taking $\lvert \alpha \rvert \to \infty$ and the coupling to zero.
This resolves the discrepancy between coherent-state dynamics and semiclassical
Rabi oscillations in both standard and ultrastrong coupling/driving regimes.
Furthermore, it provides a framework for studying the quantum-to-classical
transition, with potential applications in quantum technologies.

periodically-driven qubit coupled to a dissipative bosonic environment. We
propagate the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the qubit by
integrating the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion.
Non-Markovian features are quantified by comparing on an equal footing the
predictions from diverse and complementary approaches to quantum dissipation.
In particular, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum states, the decay
of the volume accessible to the qubit on the Hilbert space, the negativity of
the canonical rates in the generalized Lindblad equation and the relaxation of
the memory kernels in the Nakajima--Zwanzig generalized quantum master
equation. We study the effects of controlled driving on the coherent dynamics
of the system. We show that a suitable external field can offset the ergodic
relaxation of time correlation functions, increase distinguishability over time
and strengthen non-Markovian effects witnessed by the canonical dissipation
channels. We furthermore observe the phenomenon of eternal non-Markovianity for
sufficiently small system-bath coupling and we discuss how this can be enhanced
by modulating the frequency of the external drive. The present work provides a
broad theoretical analysis of quantum dissipation in the framework of open
quantum dynamics and quantum information.

                                        <span>  Quantum algorithms for tasks such as factorization, search, and simulation
rely on control flow such as branching and iteration that depends on the value
of data in superposition. High-level programming abstractions for control flow,
such as switches, loops, and higher-order functions, are ubiquitous in
classical languages. By contrast, many quantum languages do not provide
high-level abstractions for control flow in superposition, and instead require
the use of hardware-level logic gates to implement such control flow.
  The reason for this gap is that whereas a classical computer supports control
flow using a program counter that can depend on data, the typical architecture
of a quantum computer does not provide a program counter that can depend on
data in superposition. As a result, the complete set of control flow
abstractions that can be correctly realized on a quantum computer has not yet
been established.
  In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the properties of
control flow abstractions that are correctly realizable on a quantum computer.
First, we prove that even on a quantum computer whose program counter exists in
superposition, one cannot correctly realize control flow in quantum algorithms
by lifting the classical conditional jump instruction to work in superposition.
This theorem denies the ability to directly lift general abstractions for
control flow such as the $\lambda$-calculus from classical to quantum
programming.
  In response, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for control
flow to be correctly realizable on a quantum computer. We introduce the quantum
control machine, an instruction set architecture featuring a conditional jump
that is restricted to satisfy these conditions. We show how this design enables
a developer to correctly express control flow in quantum algorithms using a
program counter in place of logic gates.

                                        <span>  A number of exciting recent results have been seen in the field of quantum
error correction. These include initial demonstrations of error correction on
current quantum hardware, and resource estimates which improve understanding of
the requirements to run large-scale quantum algorithms for real-world
applications. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two developments by
performing careful estimation of the resources required to fault-tolerantly
perform quantum phase estimation (QPE) on a minimal chemical example.
Specifically, we describe a detailed compilation of the QPE circuit to lattice
surgery operations for the rotated surface code, for a hydrogen molecule in a
minimal basis set. We describe a number of optimisations at both the
algorithmic and error correction levels. We find that implementing even a
simple chemistry circuit requires 1,000 qubits and 2,300 quantum error
correction rounds, emphasising the need for improved error correction
techniques specifically targeting the early fault-tolerant regime.

                                        <span>  Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating
periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these
oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron dynamics
and mechanical motion. We show that, due to the complexity of this mechanism,
these self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable behaviour
causing hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles and characterize
the stability of different regimes in both single and double quantum dot
configurations. In particular cases, we find these oscillations stable for over
20 seconds, many orders of magnitude above electronic and mechanical
characteristic timescales, revealing the robustness of the mechanism at play.

environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated
Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site
form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network
simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the
doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the
idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set
of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are
governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced
non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features
of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be
made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities
for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.

                                        <span>  In this theoretical investigation, we study the effectiveness of a protocol
that incorporates periodic quantum resetting to prepare ground states of
frustration-free parent Hamiltonians. This protocol uses a steering Hamiltonian
that enables local coupling between the system and ancillary degrees of
freedom. At periodic intervals, the ancillary system is reset to its initial
state. For infinitesimally short reset times, the dynamics can be approximated
by a Lindbladian whose steady state is the target state. For finite reset
times, however, the spin chain and the ancilla become entangled between reset
operations. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we employ Matrix
Product State simulations and quantum trajectory techniques, focusing on the
preparation of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. Our analysis
considers convergence time, fidelity, and energy evolution under different
reset intervals. Our numerical results show that ancilla system entanglement is
essential for faster convergence. In particular, there exists an optimal reset
time at which the protocol performs best. Using a simple approximation, we
provide insights into how to optimally choose the mapping operators applied to
the system during the reset procedure. Furthermore, the protocol shows
remarkable resilience to small deviations in reset time and dephasing noise.
Our study suggests that stroboscopic maps using quantum resetting may offer
advantages over alternative methods, such as quantum reservoir engineering and
quantum state steering protocols, which rely on Markovian dynamics.

                                        <span>  Recently, there has been considerable interest in "sonifying" scientific
data; however, sonifying quantum processes using the newest quantum
technologies, including Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum devices and quantum
random number generators, is still an emerging area of research. Music
technologists and composers employ the growing accessibility to diverse data
from quantum mechanics as musical tools in the hope of generating new sound
expressions. How different is the quantum world from the classical one, and is
it possible to express the quantum world using sounds? Quantum phenomena are
very different from those that we experience in our everyday lives. Thus, it is
challenging to understand them intuitively. In this paper, we propose
sonification as a method toward an intuitive understanding of various quantum
mechanical phenomena, from Rabi oscillations and resonance fluorescence of a
single atom through the generation of Schr\"odinger cat states in strong laser
field physics to insulator-superfluid transition in quantum many-body systems.
This paper illustrates various methods we experimented with in sonification and
score representations of quantum data depending on the source data and
performance settings.

authentication within information processing systems. As the prevalence of
digital imagery continues to grow, safeguarding this form of data becomes
increasingly crucial. However, existing security protocols, reliant on complex
mathematical models, exhibit vulnerabilities in effectively protecting
information from both internal and external threats. Moreover, the forthcoming
advent of quantum computing poses a significant challenge, as it could decrypt
data encrypted by classical. In this paper, we propose an efficient
implementation scheme for a quantum image encryption algorithm combining the
generalized affine transform and logistic map. We evaluated developed quantum
circuits using qiskit and quantum devices to validate the encryption technique.
Through comprehensive performance analysis, we have demonstrated the efficiency
of the chosen encryption algorithm across various criteria. Furthermore, we
introduce a hybrid methodology aimed at mitigating circuit complexity and
reducing quantum cost. Leveraging the Espresso algorithm and incorporating an
ancilla qubit into the circuitry, we achieve a remarkable 50\% reduction in
cost while maintaining security and efficiency. Finally, we conducted
robustness and security analyses to assess the resilience of our encryption
method against diverse noise attacks. The results confirm that our proposed
quantum image encryption technique provides a secure solution and offers
precise and measurable quantum image processing capabilities.

breaking the symmetry between the two triangular sublattices of which the
honeycomb one is a superposition. We establish the conditions of band gap
opening, compute the width of the gap, and characterize its topological
property by a topological index (Chern number). The topological nature of the
band gap leads to inversion of the population imbalance between the two
triangular sublattices for modes with frequencies near band edges. It also
prohibits a transition to the trivial limit of infinitely spaced,
noninteracting atoms without closing the spectral gap. Surrounding the lattice
by a Fabry-P\'erot cavity with small intermirror spacing $d < {\pi}/k_0$ ,
where $k_0$ is the free-space wave number at the atomic resonance frequency,
renders the system Hermitian by suppressing the leakage of energy out of the
atomic plane without modifying its topological properties. In contrast, a
larger $d$ allows for propagating optical modes that are built up due to
reflections at the cavity mirrors and have frequencies inside the band gap of
the free-standing lattice, thus closing the latter.

                                        <span>  Quantum generative modeling is a growing area of interest for
industry-relevant applications. With the field still in its infancy, there are
many competing techniques. This work is an attempt to systematically compare a
broad range of these techniques to guide quantum computing practitioners when
deciding which models and techniques to use in their applications. We compare
fundamentally different architectural ansatzes of parametric quantum circuits
used for quantum generative modeling: 1. A continuous architecture, which
produces continuous-valued data samples, and 2. a discrete architecture, which
samples on a discrete grid. We compare the performance of different data
transformations: normalization by the min-max transform or by the probability
integral transform. We learn the underlying probability distribution of the
data sets via two popular training methods: 1. quantum circuit Born machines
(QCBM), and 2. quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN). We study their
performance and trade-offs as the number of model parameters increases, with
the baseline of similarly trained classical neural networks. The study is
performed on six low-dimensional synthetic and two real financial data sets.
Our two key findings are that: 1. For all data sets, our quantum models require
similar or fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. In the extreme
case, the quantum models require two of orders of magnitude less parameters. 2.
We empirically find that a variant of the discrete architecture, which learns
the copula of the probability distribution, outperforms all other methods.

                                        <span>  We show that weakly entangled states can improve communication over a qubit
channel using only separate, interference-free, measurements of individual
photons. We introduce a communication task corresponding to the cryptographic
primitive known as secret sharing and show that all steerable two-qubit
isotropic states provide a quantum advantage in the success rate using only
product measurements. Furthermore, we show that such measurements can even
reveal communication advantages from noisy partially entangled states that
admit no quantum steering. We then go further and consider a stochastic variant
of secret sharing based on more sophisticated, yet standard, partial Bell state
analysers, and show that this reveals advantages also for a range of
unsteerable isotropic states. By preparing polarisation qubits in unsteerable
states, we experimentally demonstrate improved success rates of both secret
sharing tasks beyond the best entanglement-unassisted qubit protocol. Our
results reveal the capability of simple and scalable measurements in
entanglement-assisted quantum communication to overcome large amounts of noise.

Bernevig Hughes model, defines a matrix algorithm based on the reverse process
of convolution, and constructs an expression for the quantum Rubik's Cube
matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation of the
quantum Rubik's Cube matrix clearer, we use a Josephus ring to draw a
topological graph of the Rubik's Cube expansion. This article uses a quantum
Rubik's Cube to calculate energy level transitions of electrons, and shows that
its operation corresponds to path integration. The band dispersion is obtained.
This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonians and
studying energy level structure.

                                        <span>  We find the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the vacuum state in scalar
quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so
leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The
area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless
limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation
group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions
suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the
renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in
scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the
increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in
entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed.
We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy
in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of
screening.

regarded as reliable tools in dissipative modeling. Intriguingly, existing
literature often obtains an equivalent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian by neglecting
the quantum jumping terms in the master equation. However, there lacks
investigation into the effects of discarded terms as well as the unified
connection between these two approaches. In this study, we study the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with collective loss and gain from a topological
perspective. When the system undergoes no quantum jump events, the
corresponding shape matrix exhibits the same topological properties in contrast
to the traditional non-Hermitian theory. Conversely, the occurrence of quantum
jumps can result in a shift in the positions of the phase transition. Our study
provides a qualitative analysis of the impact of quantum jumping terms and
reveals their unique role in quantum systems.

enhance its sensitivity in certain measurment schemes. The canonical approach,
based on parametric modulation of the oscillation frequency, is usually limited
to a squeezing of at most 3 dB. However, this can be overcome by additional
stabilization of the anti-squeezed quadrature. Here, we apply this approach to
highly-stressed silicon nitride membrane resonators, with effective masses of
the order few nanograms and quality factors routinely exceeding 108, which hold
promise for sensing applications in both the classical and quantum regimes. We
benchmark their performance using either piezo or capacitive parametric
modulation. We observe maximum thermomechanical squeezing by record-high 17 dB
and 21 dB, respectively, and we argue that even larger values can be attained
with minimal changes to the device design. Finally, we provide a full quantum
theory of a combination of this approach with quantum-limited motion
measurement and conclude that quantum squeezing is attainable at moderate
cryogenic temperatures.

                                        <span>  It has recently been shown that relativistic quantum theory leads to a local
interpretation of quantum mechanics wherein the universal wavefunction in
configuration space is entirely replaced with an ensemble of local fluid
equations in spacetime. For want of a fully relativistic quantum fluid
treatment, we develop a model using the nonrelativistic Madelung equations, and
obtain conditions for them to be local in spacetime. Every particle in the
Madelung fluid is equally real, and has a definite position, momentum, kinetic
energy, and potential energy. These are obtained by defining quantum momentum
and kinetic energy densities for the fluid and separating the momentum into
average and symmetric parts, and kinetic energy into classical kinetic and
quantum potential parts. The two types of momentum naturally give rise to a
single classical kinetic energy density, which contains the expected kinetic
energy, even for stationary states, and we define the reduced quantum potential
as the remaining part of the quantum kinetic energy density. We treat the
quantum potential as a novel mode of internal energy storage within the fluid
particles, which explains most of the nonclassical behavior of the Madelung
fluid. For example, we show that in tunneling phenomena the quantum potential
negates the barrier so that nothing prevents the fluid from flowing through. We
show how energy flows and transforms in this model, and that enabling local
conservation of energy requires defining a quantum potential energy current
that flows through the fluid rather than only flowing with it. The
nonrelativistic treatment generally contains singularities in the velocity
field, which undermines the goal of local dynamics, but we expect a proper
relativistic treatment will bound the fluid particle velocities at $c$.

                                        <span>  The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and
topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase
transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and
condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing
first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in
systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as
second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence
of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase
transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second
order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects
in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be
predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

                                        <span>  We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by
analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the
entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum
models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly
entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground
states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we
reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic
divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established
super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where
the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz
matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of
a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the
entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this
pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We
provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights
into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights
gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the
logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the
Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the
entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on
the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.

between remote location with the help of quantum repeaters. The famous
Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum repeater protocol is based on long distance
single-photon interference, which not only requires high phase stability but
also cannot generate maximally entangled state. Here, we propose a quantum
repeater protocol using the idea of post-matching, which retains the same
efficiency as the single-photon interference protocol, reduces the
phase-stability requirement and can generate maximally entangled state in
principle. Numerical simulations show that our protocol has its superiority by
comparing with existing protocols under a generic noise model. Our work
uncovers the internal connection between quantum key distribution and quantum
repeater, which brings new insight to the development of these two fields. We
believe our work represents a crucial step towards the construction of a
fully-connected quantum network.

                                        <span>  We investigate the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect, by placing a quantum
system in free-fall around a gravitating body {\it e.g.} a satellite orbiting
the Earth. Since the system is in free-fall, by the equivalence principle, the
quantum system is locally in flat, gravity-free space-time - it is screened
from the gravitational field. For a slightly elliptical orbit, the
gravitational potential will change with time. This leads to the energy levels
of the quantum system developing side bands which is the signature for this
version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This contrasts with the normal signature
of the Aharonov-Bohm effect of shifting of interference fringes.

                                        <span>  We establish a quantum theory of computational ghost imaging and propose
quantum projection imaging where object information can be reconstructed by
quantum statistical correlation between a certain photon number of bucket
signal and DMD random patterns. The reconstructed image can be negative or
positive depending on the chosen photon number. In particular, the vacuum state
(zero-number) projection produces a negative image with better visibility and
contrast-to-noise ratio. The experimental results of quantum projection imaging
agree well with theoretical simulations and show that, under the same
measurement condition, vacuum projection imaging is superior to conventional
and fast first-photon ghost imaging in low-light illumination.

both scalable quantum computing and quantum networking. Entanglement of remote
qubits via photons has been demonstrated in many platforms; however, improving
the rate of entanglement generation will be instrumental for integrating
photonic links into modular quantum computers. We present an ion trap system
that has the highest reported free-space photon collection efficiency for
quantum networking. We use a pair of in-vacuum aspheric lenses, each with a
numerical aperture of 0.8, to couple 10% of the 493 nm photons emitted from a
$^{138}$Ba$^+$ ion into single-mode fibers. We also demonstrate that proximal
effects of the lenses on the ion position and motion can be mitigated.

                                        <span>  Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics
that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum
field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential
attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular,
their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this
common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological
orders with distance-dependent interacting anyons. As we illustrate, in some
instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that
densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically
described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by
performing dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders.
Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories
to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The
low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal
effects than those of surface codes.

                                        <span>  Integrated photonics has been a promising platform for analog quantum
simulation of condensed matter phenomena in strongly correlated systems. To
that end, we explore the implementation of all-photonic quantum simulators in
coupled cavity arrays with integrated ensembles of spectrally disordered
emitters. Our model is reflective of color center ensembles integrated into
photonic crystal cavity arrays. Using the Quantum Master Equation and the
Effective Hamiltonian approaches, we study energy band formation and
wavefunction properties in the open quantum Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard framework.
We find conditions for polariton creation and (de)localization under
experimentally relevant values of disorder in emitter frequencies, cavity
resonance frequencies, and emitter-cavity coupling rates. To quantify these
properties, we introduce two metrics, the polaritonic and nodal participation
ratios, that characterize the light-matter hybridization and the node
delocalization of the wavefunction, respectively. These new metrics combined
with the Effective Hamiltonian approach prove to be a powerful toolbox for
cavity quantum electrodynamical engineering of solid-state systems.

                                        <span>  Quantum magnetometry uses quantum resources to measure magnetic fields with
precision and accuracy that cannot be achieved by its classical counterparts.
In this paper, we propose a scheme for quantum magnetometry using discrete-time
quantum walk (DTQW) where multi-path interference plays a central role. The
dynamics of a spin-half particle implementing DTQW on a one-dimensional lattice
gets affected by magnetic fields, and the controlled dynamics of DTQW help in
estimating the fields' strength. To gauge the effects of the field, we study
the variance of the particle's position probability distribution (PD) and use
it to determine the direction of the magnetic field maximally affecting the
quantum walk. We then employ statistical tools like quantum Fisher information
(QFI) and Fisher information (FI) of the particle's position and spin
measurements to assess the system's sensitivity to the magnetic fields. We find
that one can use the position and spin measurements to estimate the strengths
of the magnetic fields. Calculations for an electron implementing quantum walk
of fifty time steps show that the estimate had a root-mean-square error of the
order of 0.1 picoTesla. Moreover, the sensitivity of our system can be tuned to
measure any desired magnetic field. Our results indicate that the system can be
used as a tool for optimal quantum magnetometry.

                                        <span>  Quantum walks have been used to develop quantum algorithms since their
inception, and can be seen as an alternative to the usual circuit model;
combining single-particle quantum walks on sparse graphs with two-particle
scattering on a line lattice is sufficient to perform universal quantum
computation. In this work we solve the problem of two-particle scattering on
the line lattice for a family of interactions without translation invariance,
recovering the Bose-Hubbard interaction as the limiting case. Due to its
generality, our systematic approach lays the groundwork to solve the more
general problem of multi-particle scattering on general graphs, which in turn
can enable design of different or simpler quantum gates and gadgets. As a
consequence of this work, we show that a CPHASE gate can be achieved with high
fidelity when the interaction acts only on a small portion of the line graph.

                                        <span>  We consider an $n\times n$ system of ODEs on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with a simple
pole $A$ at $z=0$ and a double pole $u={\rm diag}(u_1, \dots, u_n)$ at
$z=\infty$. This is the simplest situation in which the monodromy data of the
system are described by upper and lower triangular Stokes matrices $S_\pm$, and
we impose reality conditions which imply $S_-=S_+^\dagger$. We study leading
WKB exponents of Stokes matrices in parametrizations given by generalized
minors and by spectral coordinates, and we show that for $u$ on the caterpillar
line (which corresponds to the limit $(u_{j+1}-u_j)/(u_j- u_{j-1}) \to \infty$
for $j=2, \cdots, n-1$), the real parts of these exponents are given by periods
of certain cycles on the degenerate spectral curve $\Gamma(u_{\rm cat}(t), A)$.
  These cycles admit unique deformations for $u$ near the caterpillar line.
Using the spectral network theory, we give for $n=2$, and $n=3$ exact WKB
predictions for asymptotics of generalized minors in terms of periods of these
cycles. Boalch's theorem from Poisson geometry implies that real parts of
leading WKB exponents satisfy the rhombus (or interlacing) inequalities. We
show that these inequalities are in correspondence with finite webs of the
canonical foliation on the root curve $\Gamma^r(u, A)$, and that they follow
from the positivity of the corresponding periods. We conjecture that a similar
mechanism applies for $n>3$.
  We also outline the relation of the spectral coordinates with the cluster
structures considered by Goncharov-Shen, and with ${\mathcal N}=2$
supersymmetric quantum field theories in dimension four associated with some
simple quivers.

zonal current in, a thermal rotating shallow-water model, sometimes called
\emph{Ripa's model}, featuring stratification for quasigeostrophic upper-ocean
dynamics. The model has Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. In addition to
Casimirs, the model supports integrals of motion that neither form the kernel
of the bracket nor are related to explicit symmetries. The model sustains
Rossby waves and a neutral model, whose spurious growth is prevented by a
positive-definite integral, quadratic on the deviation from the motionless
state. A baroclinic zonal jet with vertical curvature is found to be spectrally
stable for specific configurations of the gradients of layer thickness,
vertically averaged buoyancy, and buoyancy frequency. Only a subset of such
states was found Lyapunov stable using the available integrals, except the
newly reported ones, whose role in constraining stratified thermal flow remains
elusive. The existence of Lyapunov-stable states enabled bounding the nonlinear
growth of perturbations to spectrally unstable states. Our results do not
support the generality of earlier numerical evidence on the suppression of
submesoscale wave activity as a result of the inclusion of stratification in
thermal shallow-water theory, which we supported with direct numerical
simulations.

arising from the study of collinear limits of perturbative gravity amplitudes
in flat space. We explain from the twistor perspective how a non-vanishing
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ naturally modifies the celestial chiral
algebra. The cosmological constant deforms the Poisson bracket on twistor
space, so the corresponding deformed algebra of Hamiltonians under the new
bracket is automatically consistent. This algebra is equivalent to that
recently found by Taylor and Zhu. We find a number of variations of the
deformed algebra. We give the Noether charges arising from the expression of
this algebra as a symmetry of the twistor action for self-dual gravity with
cosmological constant.

                                        <span>  Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system
is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved.
Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The latter, however, assume initial
states which are highly concentrated around a specific energy window and, as
such, cannot account for a large class of states that are of paramount
importance and that are operationally accessible in natural physical settings,
including many experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum
simulation: low-entanglement states. In this work, we prove thermalization of
these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More
specifically, we define a random energy smoothing - motivated by arguments of
unavoidable finite resolution - on local Hamiltonians that lead to local
thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show
that such transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under a
mild condition, the short time dynamics.

                                        <span>  We consider an $n\times n$ system of ODEs on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with a simple
pole $A$ at $z=0$ and a double pole $u={\rm diag}(u_1, \dots, u_n)$ at
$z=\infty$. This is the simplest situation in which the monodromy data of the
system are described by upper and lower triangular Stokes matrices $S_\pm$, and
we impose reality conditions which imply $S_-=S_+^\dagger$. We study leading
WKB exponents of Stokes matrices in parametrizations given by generalized
minors and by spectral coordinates, and we show that for $u$ on the caterpillar
line (which corresponds to the limit $(u_{j+1}-u_j)/(u_j - u_{j-1}) \to \infty$
for $j=2, \cdots, n-1$), the real parts of these exponents are given by periods
of certain cycles on the degenerate spectral curve $\Gamma(u_{\rm cat}(t), A)$.
  These cycles admit unique deformations for $u$ near the caterpillar line.
Using the spectral network theory, we give for $n=2$, and $n=3$ exact WKB
predictions for asymptotics of generalized minors in terms of periods of these
cycles. Boalch's theorem from Poisson geometry implies that real parts of
leading WKB exponents satisfy the rhombus (or interlacing) inequalities. We
show that these inequalities are in correspondence with finite webs of the
canonical foliation on the root curve $\Gamma^r(u, A)$, and that they follow
from the positivity of the corresponding periods. We conjecture that a similar
mechanism applies for $n>3$.
  We also outline the relation of the spectral coordinates with the cluster
structures considered by Goncharov-Shen, and with ${\mathcal N}=2$
supersymmetric quantum field theories in dimension four associated with some
simple quivers.

                                        <span>  We introduce a two-parameter family of probability distributions, indexed by
$\beta/2 = \theta > 0$ and $K \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, that are called
$\beta$-Krawtchouk corners processes. These measures are related to Jack
symmetric functions, and can be thought of as integrable discretizations of
$\beta$-corners processes from random matrix theory, or alternatively as
non-determinantal measures on lozenge tilings of infinite domains. We show that
as $K$ tends to infinity the height function of these models concentrates
around an explicit limit shape, and prove that its fluctuations are
asymptotically described by a pull-back of the Gaussian free field, which
agrees with the one for Wigner matrices. The main tools we use to establish our
results are certain multi-level loop equations introduced in our earlier work

                                        <span>  Considering homogeneous four-dimensional space-time geometries within real
projective geometry provides a mathematically well-defined framework to discuss
their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate
singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act
isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce
projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on
correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and
projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their
expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes
their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on
space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We
explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the
irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey
spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework might be of use for
the consistent description of quantum fields in holographic correspondences and
their flat limits.

                                        <span>  A family of discrete Schroedinger operators is investigated through
scattering theory. The continuous spectrum of these operators exhibit changes
of multiplicity, and some of these operators possess resonances at thresholds.
It is shown that the corresponding wave operators belong to an explicitly
constructed C*-algebra, whose K-theory is carefully analysed. An index theorem
is deduced from these investigations, which corresponds to a topological
version of Levinson's theorem in presence of embedded thresholds, resonances,
and changes of multiplicity of the scattering matrices. In the second half of
the paper, very detailed computations for the simplest realisation of this
family of operators are provided. In particular, a surface of resonances is
exhibited, probably for the first time. For Levinson's theorem, it is shown
that contributions due to resonances at the lowest value and at the highest
value of the continuous spectrum play an essential role.

string spacetime by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Weyl
equations. These solutions allowed us to study the behaviour of such massless
fermions in terms of the cosmological constant, the black string's mass and the
radial distance of the particle from the black string. The solutions, written
in terms of Parabolic Cylinder functions and Laguerre polynomials, were
obtained for a particle far from the black string and around the horizon event.
For the particle around the event horizon, for all configuration of parameters,
the energy eigenvalues are complex-valued, indicating QNM similarly to the case
of spherical black holes. For the particle far from the black string, the
energies derived from the Weyl equation set up conditions on the parameters in
order to keep the energy as a real valued parameter.

a self-adjoint operator. However, for any dimension there exists a natural
family of functions that can be interpreted as Green's functions of the
Laplacian with a spherically symmetric point potential. In dimensions 1, 2, 3
they are the integral kernels of the resolvent of well-defined self-adjoint
operators. In higher dimensions they are not even integral kernels of bounded
operators. Their construction uses the so-called generalized integral, a
concept going back to Riesz and Hadamard.
  We consider the Laplace(-Beltrami) operator on the Euclidean space, the
hyperbolic space and the sphere in any dimension. We describe the corresponding
Green's functions, also perturbed by a point potential. We describe their limit
as the scaled hyperbolic space and the scaled sphere approach the Euclidean
space. Especially interesting is the behavior of positive eigenvalues of the
spherical Laplacian, which undergo a shift proportional to a negative power of
the radius of the sphere.
  We expect that in any dimension our constructions yield possible behaviors of
the integral kernel of the resolvent of a perturbed Laplacian far from the
support of the perturbation. Besides, they can be viewed as toy models
illustrating various aspects of renormalization in Quantum Field Theory,
especially the point-splitting method and dimensional regularization.

                                        <span>  We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the
thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with
finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs
state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result
implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties
and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries.
Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect
to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence
is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the
Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's
theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in
the bulk.

connected K\"ahler manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$. To associate the quantum state
with the subset, we use the map that restricts holomorphic sections of the
quantum line bundle over the product of the two K\"ahler manifolds to the
subset. We present a description of the kernel of this restriction map when the
subset is a finite union of products. This in turn shows that the quantum
states associated with the finite union of products are separable. Finally, for
every pure state and certain mixed state, we construct subsets of $M_1\times
M_2$ such that the states associated with these subsets are the original
states, to begin with.

theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the
$d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer
a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$
theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $N=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational
anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance
in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive
anomaly computation for (4,0) and (3,1) tensor supermultiplets, respectively,
for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed
$R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving
$R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to
address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.

asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and the height function of the half
space six vertex model at the boundary at large times. We establish a phase
transition depending on the asymptotic density of particles at the boundary,
with GSE and GOE limits as well as the Baik--Rains crossover distribution near
the critical point. This was previously known for half space last passage
percolation, and recently established for the half space log-gamma polymer and
KPZ equation in the groundbreaking work of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto.
  The proof uses the underlying algebraic structure of these models in a
crucial way to obtain exact formulas. In particular, we show a relationship
between the half space six vertex model and a half space Hall--Littlewood
measure with two boundary parameters, which is then matched to a free boundary
Schur process via a new identity of symmetric functions. Fredholm Pfaffian
formulas are established for the half space ASEP and six vertex model,
indicating a hidden free fermionic structure.

                                        <span>  We consider Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system forced to move on a
submanifold $G_\alpha(q^A)=0$. If for some reasons we are interested in knowing
the dynamics of all original variables $q^A(t)$, the most economical would be a
Hamiltonian formulation on the intermediate phase-space submanifold spanned by
reducible variables $q^A$ and an irreducible set of momenta $p_i$,
$[i]=[A]-[\alpha]$. We describe and compare two different possibilities for
establishing the Poisson structure and Hamiltonian dynamics on an intermediate
submanifold: Hamiltonian reduction of the Dirac bracket and intermediate
formalism. As an example of the application of intermediate formalism, we
deduce on this basis the Euler-Poisson equations of a spinning body, establish
the underlying Poisson structure, and write their general solution in terms of
the exponential of the Hamiltonian vector field.

a new presentation of the deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$,
and we give a rigorous mathematical construction of the

of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ is also obtained. We construct
various coproducts of these algebras, which are expected to encode the fusions
of defects in twisted M-theory. The matrix extended Miura operators are
identified as intertwiners in certain bimodules of these algebras.

                                        <span>  Quantum field theories can be applied to compute various statistical
properties of random tensors. In particular signed distributions of tensor
eigenvalues/vectors are the easiest, which can be computed as partition
functions of four-fermi theories. Though signed distributions are different
from genuine ones because of extra signs of weights, they are expected to
coincide in vicinities of ends of distributions. In this paper, we perform a
case study of the signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of the real symmetric
order-three random tensor. The correct critical point and the correct end in
the large $N$ limit are obtained from the four-fermi theory, for which a method
using the Schwinger-Dyson equation is very efficient. Since locations of ends
are particularly important in applications, such as the largest eigenvalues and
the best rank-one tensor approximations, signed distributions are the easiest
and highly useful through the Schwinger-Dyson method.

                                        <span>  Modern theories of phase transitions and scale-invariance are rooted in path
integral formulation and renormalization groups (RG). Despite the applicability
of these approaches on simple systems with only pairwise interactions, they are
less effective on complex systems with un-decomposable high-order interactions
(i.e., interactions among arbitrary sets of units). To precisely characterize
the universality of high-order interacting systems, we propose simplex path
integral and simplex renormalization group (SRG) as the generalizations of
classic approaches to arbitrary high-order and heterogeneous interactions. We
first formalize the trajectories of units governed by high-order interactions
to define path integrals on corresponding simplexes based on a high-order
propagator. Then we develop a method to integrate out short-range high-order
interactions in the momentum space, accompanied by a coarse graining procedure
functioning on the simplex structure generated by high-order interactions. The
proposed SRG, equipped with a divide-and-conquer framework, can deal with the
absence of ergodicity arised from the sparse distribution of high-order
interactions and renormalize a system with intertwined high-order interactions
on $p$-order according to its properties on $q$-order ($p\leq q$). The
associated scaling relation and its corollaries support to differentiate among
scale-invariant, weakly scale-invariant, and scale-dependent systems across
different orders. We have validated our theory in multi-order scale-invariance
verification, topological invariance discovery, organizational structure
identification, and information bottleneck analysis to demonstrate its capacity
for identifying intrinsic properties of high-order interacting systems during
system reduction.

                                        <span>  Utilizing the electric Harrison transformation developed in five-dimensional
minimal supergravity, we construct an exact solution characterizing non-BPS
charged rotating black holes with a horizon cross-section of a lens space
L(n;1). Among these solutions, only the ones corresponding to n=0 and n=1 do
not have any curvature singularities, conical singularities, Dirac-Misner
string singularities, and orbifold singularities both on and outside the
horizon; additionally, it is free from closed timelike curves. The solution for
n=0 corresponds to the charged dipole black ring that we constructed in the
previous paper. The specific solution for n=1, referred to as the ``capped
black hole," was introduced in our previous letter. This provides the first
example of a non-BPS exact solution, representing an asymptotically flat,
stationary spherical black hole with a domain of outer communication (DOC)
having a nontrivial topology in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We
demonstrate that the DOC on a timeslice has the topology of $[R^4\# CP^2
]\setminus B^4$. Differing from the well-known Myers-Perry and Cveti\v{c}-Youm
black holes describing a spherical horizon topology and a DOC with a trivial
topology of $R^4 \setminus B^4$ on a timeslice, the capped black hole's horizon
is capped by a disc-shaped bubble. We explicitly demonstrate that the capped
black hole carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a
magnetic flux, with only three of these quantities being independent.
Furthermore, we reveal that this black hole can possess identical conserved
charges as the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole. The existence of this solution
challenges black hole uniqueness beyond both the black ring and the BPS
spherical black hole. Moreover, within specific parameter regions, the capped
black hole can exhibit a larger entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.

                                        <span>  The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is
likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective
real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all
retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a
conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a
`CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken
translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows
a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators
(poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the
thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and
gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis
thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled
results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.

under the conformal motion treatment within the context of f(Q) gravity. We
have developed two models by implementing the power-law and linear form of
conformal factor, enabling an in-depth comparison in our study. We have
selected the MIT Bag model equation of state to describe the connection between
pressure and energy density and matched the interior spherically symmetric
space-time with the Bardeen space-time. In addition, the present research
examines various physically valid characteristics of realistic stars, such as
PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and SMC X-1. We compare two
constructed models by attributing the behavior of density, pressure,
equilibrium conditions, and the adiabatic index. We have additionally included
a brief analysis of the scenario involving Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as an
external geometry for the matching condition. In contrast to the
Reissner-Nordstrom instance, the Bardeen model with the extra term in the
asymptotic representations yields a more intriguing and viable result. The
current analysis reveals that the resulting compact star solutions are
physically acceptable and authentic when considering the presence of charge
with conformal motion in f(Q) gravity.

                                        <span>  We explore the new physics phenomena of gravidynamics governed by the
inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry based on the gravitational quantum field
theory. Such a gravidynamics enables us to derive the generalized Einstein
equation and an equation beyond it. To simplify the analyses, we linearize the
dynamic equations of gravitational interaction by keeping terms up to the
leading order in the dual gravigauge field. We then apply the linearized
dynamic equations into two particular gravitational phenomena. First, we
consider the linearized equations in the absence of source fields, which is
shown to have five physical propagating polarizations as gravitational waves,
i.e., two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar, instead of two tensor
polarizations in the general relativity. Second, we examine the Newtonian limit
in which the gravitational fields and the matter source distribution are weak
and static. By deriving the associated Poisson equation, we obtain the exact
relation of the fundamental interaction coupling in the gravidynamics with the
experimentally measured Newtonian constant. We also make use of nonrelativistic
objects and relativistic photons to probe the Newtonian field configurations.
In particular, the experiments from the gravitational deflection of light rays
and the Shapiro time delay can place stringent constraints on the linearized
gravidynamics in the gravitational quantum field theory.

string spacetime by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Weyl
equations. These solutions allowed us to study the behaviour of such massless
fermions in terms of the cosmological constant, the black string's mass and the
radial distance of the particle from the black string. The solutions, written
in terms of Parabolic Cylinder functions and Laguerre polynomials, were
obtained for a particle far from the black string and around the horizon event.
For the particle around the event horizon, for all configuration of parameters,
the energy eigenvalues are complex-valued, indicating QNM similarly to the case
of spherical black holes. For the particle far from the black string, the
energies derived from the Weyl equation set up conditions on the parameters in

                                        <span>  We propose to adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in
order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to
physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge
transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and
analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of
the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in
terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling
solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow
equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we
discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory
in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient
of the kinetic term.

necessarily equal to the dimension of the corresponding curved manifold and on
the known fact that gravitational theories can be formulated in a gauge
theoretic way, we discuss how to describe all known interactions in a unified
manner. This is achieved by enlarging the tangent group of the four-dimensional
manifold to $SO(2,16)$, which permits the inclusion of both gauge groups, the
one that describes gravity as a gauge theory as well as the $SO(10)$ describing
the internal interactions. Moreover it permits the use of both Weyl and
Majorana conditions imposed on the fermions, as to avoid the duplication of
fermion multiplets of $SO(10)$ appearing in previous attempts. The gravity
theory discussed in the present work is the Conformal Gravity which, after a
spontaneous symmetry breaking, can lead either to Weyl Gravity or to the usual
Einstein Gravity.

by a comparable mass-ratio black hole merger is modeled by the greybody factor
of the remnant black hole. Our model does not include fitting parameters except
for a single overall spectral amplitude. We perform the mass-spin inference
from the SXS data without introducing fitting parameters and without tuning the
data range of each SXS template. Also, we find that the exponential damping in
the ringdown spectral amplitude can be modeled well with the exponential
damping in the greybody factor at high frequencies. Based on the findings, we
propose a conjecture that the light ring of the remnant black hole, which
sources the ringdown, forms as early as during the merger stage. We discuss the
formation of the light ring in the static binary solution as a first step
towards the understanding of how the separation of merging black holes may
affect the formation of the light ring.

scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field,
which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically
symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m
solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including
derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two
asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial
infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To
understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field
equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types
of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence
of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important
role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of
different interactions at a large coupling limit.

                                        <span>  We employ double holography to examine a system of two entangled gravitating
universes that live on two codimension-one branes in an asymptotically AdS$_3$
spacetime with two disjoint conformal boundaries. There are distinct brane
configurations depending on the temperature of the thermofield double (TFD)
state between the left and right systems. The topology transition between two
branes is naturally identified with the emergence of an Einstein-Rosen bridge
connecting the two entangled universes. This doubly holographic construction
offers a holographic perspective on gravitational collapse and black hole
formation in brane universes. Through this holographic framework, we analyze
the quantum information structure of the two gravitating universes.
Specifically, we calculate the mutual information between defects present in
the boundary theories on the left and right sides. Furthermore, we investigate
the decoupling process in the Hayden-Preskill protocol applied to the two
copies of the defect field theory and discuss the interpretation of the
Yoshida-Kitaev decoding protocol.

                                        <span>  Recent investigations [arXiv:2111.02429][arXiv:2210.09647][arXiv:2304.05453]
have introduced an infinite class of novel gravitational observables in
Asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) space that reside on codimension-one or
-zero regions of the bulk spacetime. These observables encompass
well-established holographic complexity measures such as the maximum volume of
the extremal hypersurfaces and the action or spacetime volume of the
Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch. Furthermore, this family of observables exhibits
two universal properties when applied to the thermofield double (TFD) state:
they exhibit linear growth at late times and faithfully reproduce the
switchback effect. This implies that any observable from this class has the
potential to serve as a gravitational dual for the circuit complexity of
boundary states.

\hat{p}_1 + \hat{p}_3 \hat{p_2} \right)$ for large $\kappa$ and the initial
quantum state is $\Psi_{in} (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \prod_{j=1}^3 \phi_j (x_j)$, the
joint measurement of complementary variables $x_3$ and $p_3$ at $t = 1 /

well-known Arthurs-Keller inequality $\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} (t = 1 / \kappa)
\Delta_{ \hat{x}_2} (t = 1 / \kappa) \geq 1$ arising when all $\phi_j (x_j)$
are the minimal uncertainty Gaussian states. If the initial probe state is
entangled, it is shown that the generalized Arthurs-Kelly inequality can be
violated. We show the violation explicitly by introducing a special example.

theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the
$d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer
a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$
theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $N=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational
anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance
in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive
anomaly computation for (4,0) and (3,1) tensor supermultiplets, respectively,
for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed
$R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving
$R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to
address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.

                                        <span>  We study quark and lepton flavor structures on magnetized $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$
twisted orbifold model. There are 6,460 number of flavor models but most of
them cannot lead to realistic flavor observables because of the difficulties on
realizing mass hierarchies and small (large) mixing angles of quarks (leptons).
We find that certain zero point patterns of zero-modes of fermions and Higgs
fields give the flavor models being able to avoid these difficulties. We
classify such flavor models and show numerical example.
  Next we study four-dimensional (4D) modular symmetric quark flavor models
without fine-tuning. Mass matrices become hierarchical as close to the modular
symmetric points depending on its residual charges. Actually the residual $Z_N$
symmetries with $N\geq 6$ can originate the large quark mass hierarchies. Also
the products of residual symmetries such as $Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$ have such
possibility. We study the quark flavor model with $\Gamma_6$ symmetry and
$A_4\times A_4\times A_4$ symmetry. We assume the vicinity of the cusp
$\tau=i\infty$ where residual $Z_6$ and $Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$ symmetry
remain. Consequently we find the models realizing the order of the quark mass
ratios and the absolute values of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix
elements without fine-tuning.
  Finally we construct the Siegel modular forms. Zero-modes on $T^6$ at
$\vec{z}=0$ are the Siegel modular forms of weight 1/2 for the subgroup of
$Sp(6,\mathbb{Z})$. They have several moduli parameters and therefore have the
possibility realizing the flavor structures including the CP phases. We study
the Siegel modular forms transformed by $\widetilde{\Delta}(96)$ and show
numerical example. We find one of moduli parameters $\omega_1$ works on the
large mass hierarchies and $\omega_2$ works on the CP violation successfully in
our model.

perturbation (quench) is considered. A new approach to descriptions of a quench
from an arbitrary initial state is developed in the framework of the Keldysh
technique. This approach does not require the procedure of the analytical
continuation, which can be ambiguous in some cases. The evolution of the energy
density after local quench is calculated for a simple case, and its dependence
on the interaction region width and the initial conditions is analysed.

                                        <span>  In string theories, one-loop scattering amplitudes are characterized by
integrals over genus-one surfaces using the Kronecker-Eisenstein series. A
recent methodology proposed a genus-one basis formed from products of these
series of chain topologies. A prior work further deconstructed cyclic products
of the Kronecker-Eisenstein series on this basis. Building on it, our study
further employs advanced and comprehensive combinatorial techniques to
decompose more general genus-one integrands including a product of an arbitrary
number of cyclic products of Kronecker-Eisenstein series, supplemented by {\tt
Mathematica} codes. Our insights enhance the understanding of multiparticle
amplitudes across various string theories and illuminate loop-level parallels
with string tree-level amplitudes.

                                        <span>  We present a new method for computing multi-loop scattering amplitudes in
Quantum Field Theory. It extends the Generalized Unitarity method by
constraining not only the integrand of the amplitude but also its full
integrated form. Our approach exploits the relation between cuts and
discontinuities of the amplitude. Explicitly, by the virtue of analyticity and
unitarity of the S-matrix, the amplitude can be expressed in terms of
lower-loop on-shell amplitudes dispersively integrated along cuts. As both cuts
and discontinuities can be computed systematically in dimensional
regularization, we validated our method by reproducing the four-gluon amplitude
in two-loop massless Quantum Chromodynamics. Moreover, since our approach
improves the performance of the calculation, we provide a new result for the
four-loop four-point massless planar ladder Feynman integral. It is expressed
in terms of Harmonic Polylogarithms with letters 0 and 1.

                                        <span>  We study a correspondence between gravitational shockwave geometry and its
fluid description near a Rindler horizon in Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the
Petrov classification that describes algebraic symmetries for Lorentzian
spaces, we establish an explicit mapping between a potential fluid and the
shockwave metric perturbation, where the Einstein equation for the shockwave
geometry is equivalent to the incompressibility condition of the fluid,
augmented by a shockwave source. Then we consider an Ansatz of a stochastic
quantum source for the potential fluid, which has the physical interpretation
of shockwaves created by vacuum energy fluctuations. Under such circumstance,
the Einstein equation, or equivalently, the incompressibility condition for the
fluid, becomes a stochastic differential equation. By smearing the quantum
source on a stretched horizon in a Lorentz invariant manner with a Planckian
width (similarly to the membrane paradigm), we integrate fluctuations near the
Rindler horizon to find an accumulated effect of the variance in the round-trip
time of a photon traversing the horizon of a causal diamond.

                                        <span>  Celestial holography has led to the discovery of new symmetry algebras
arising from the study of collinear limits of perturbative gravity amplitudes
in flat space. We explain from the twistor perspective how a non-vanishing
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ naturally modifies the celestial chiral
algebra. The cosmological constant deforms the Poisson bracket on twistor
space, so the corresponding deformed algebra of Hamiltonians under the new
bracket is automatically consistent. This algebra is equivalent to that
recently found by Taylor and Zhu. We find a number of variations of the
deformed algebra. We give the Noether charges arising from the expression of
this algebra as a symmetry of the twistor action for self-dual gravity with
cosmological constant.

5 dimensions that it is useful to reorganize the conventional thermodynamics on
the inner and outer horizons in terms of left- and right-moving variables. The
insight of arXiv:2310.13437 regarding the split of variables was loosely
inspired by the example of the BTZ black hole and the corresponding dual
CFT$_2$ thermodynamics governed by the Cardy formula. Here we revisit the BTZ
case and its generalizations in 3d gravity theories with higher derivative
corrections, and show formally the applicability of the newly defined variables
and their direct relation to the Cardy formula, which is not a priori
guaranteed.

                                        <span>  Quantum gravity (QG) has a natural cutoff given by the Planck scale $M_{\rm
pl}$. However, it is known that the EFT of gravity can break down at a lower
scale, the species scale $\Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, if there are light
species of particles. Here we point out that there is a third scale
$\Lambda_{\rm BH}\lesssim \Lambda_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, which marks the
inverse length (or the temperature) of the smallest black hole where the EFT
gives a correct description of its entropy. This latter scale is hard to detect
from the viewpoint of EFT as it represents a phase transition to a state with
higher entropy. We illustrate this using examples drawn from consistent QG
landscape. In particular $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ gets related to Gregory--Laflamme
transition in the decompactification limits of quantum gravity and to the
Horowitz--Polchinski solution in the light perturbative string limits. We
propose the existence of $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ marking the temperature at which
neutral black holes undergo a phase transition, as a new Swampland condition
for all consistent quantum theories of gravity. In the asymptotic regimes of
field space $\Lambda_{\rm BH}$ is close to the mass scale of the lightest tower
but deviates from it as we move inwards in the moduli space.

metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the
inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst
invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the
above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of
natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of
this type are shown to admit an explicit UV completion in a QCD-like theory
with a Planckian confining scale. Moreover, for these models, we find regions
of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most
recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the
$1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the
Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the
inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi
parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized
inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.

their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate
singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act
isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce
projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on
correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and
projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their
expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes
their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on
space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We
explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the
irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey
spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework might be of use for
the consistent description of quantum fields in holographic correspondences and
their flat limits.

                                        <span>  In this note, we investigate a simple coordinate space structure function
${\cal E}(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to the
next-to-leading order in the large $N$ expansion. We analytically perform the
twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin representations.
Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions are naturally generated in their
Borel representations with detailed enumerations and explicit expressions
provided to all powers. The renormalon cancellation at $t=n$ between the hard
functions at powers $p$ and the non-perturbative functions at powers $p+n$ are
explicitly verified, and the issue of "scale-dependency" of the perturbative
and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. Simple expressions for
the leading power non-perturbative functions are also provided both in the
coordinate space and the momentum-fraction space ($0<\alpha<1$) with
"zero-mode-type" subtractions at $\alpha=0$ discussed in detail. In addition to
the Bjorken limit, we also perform the threshold expansion of the structure
function up to the next-to-next-to-leading threshold power exactly and
investigate its relation to the twist expansion. In the appendix, we prove that
the twist expansion is absolutely convergent for any $0<z^2<\infty$ and any $
\lambda \in iR_{\ge 0}$.

classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force
order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This
challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced
integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on
high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed
us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting
function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only
multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic
integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal -
cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell
condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the
post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to
the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.

                                        <span>  We explore the necessary conditions for 1-form symmetries to emerge in the
long-distance limit when they are explicitly broken at short distances. A
minimal requirement is that there exist operators which become topological at
long distances and that these operators have non-trivial correlation functions.
These criteria are obeyed when the would-be emergent symmetry is spontaneously
broken, or is involved in 't Hooft anomalies. On the other hand, confinement,
i.e. a phase with unbroken 1-form symmetry, is nearly incompatible with the
emergence of 1-form symmetries. We comment on some implications of our results
for QCD as well as the idea of Higgs-confinement continuity.

integrable in the presence of a mixture of Ramond-Ramond and
Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz fluxes. It is expected that this results in the
existence of a well-defined factorised worldsheet S matrix. In order to use
integrability to compute the string spectrum we need such a factorised S matrix
to exist also for the "mirror" model, obtained by a double Wick rotation of the
original worldsheet theory. In the mixed-flux case the mirror model has a
complex Hamiltonian, which raises questions on its well-definedness. In the
paper we study the worldsheet tree-level S matrix of the original and mirror
model and discuss some necessary conditions for the integrability and reality
of the spectrum.

inhomogeneous phase in rigidly rotating $N_c = 3$ gluon plasma. This mixed
phase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal
equilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase
transition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within
a few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our
results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking
of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the
confining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.

a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase
transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte
Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm
numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation
of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative
moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the
negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic
Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular
momentum of rotating plasma thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take
negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.

                                        <span>  We consider Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system forced to move on a
submanifold $G_\alpha(q^A)=0$. If for some reasons we are interested in knowing
the dynamics of all original variables $q^A(t)$, the most economical would be a
Hamiltonian formulation on the intermediate phase-space submanifold spanned by
reducible variables $q^A$ and an irreducible set of momenta $p_i$,
$[i]=[A]-[\alpha]$. We describe and compare two different possibilities for
establishing the Poisson structure and Hamiltonian dynamics on an intermediate
submanifold: Hamiltonian reduction of the Dirac bracket and intermediate
formalism. As an example of the application of intermediate formalism, we
deduce on this basis the Euler-Poisson equations of a spinning body, establish
the underlying Poisson structure, and write their general solution in terms of
the exponential of the Hamiltonian vector field.

                                        <span>  We examine the motion of the massless scalar field and nearly bound null
geodesics in the near-ring region of a black hole, which may possess either
acceleration or a gravitomagnetic mass. Around such black holes, the photon
ring deviates from the equatorial plane. In the large angular momentum limit,
we demonstrate that the massless scalar field exhibits an emergent conformal
symmetry in this near-ring region. Additionally, in the nearly bound limit, we
observe the emergence of a conformal symmetry for the null geodesics that
constitute the photon ring in the black hole image. These findings suggest that
the hidden conformal symmetry, associated with the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{s
l}(2, \mathbb{R})$, persists even for black holes lacking north-south
reflection symmetry, thereby broadening the foundation of photon ring
holography. Finally, we show that the conformal symmetry also emerges for
nearly bound timelike geodesics and scalar fields in proximity to the particle
ring, and with specific mass around a Schwarzschild black hole.

black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing
method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the
electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background
spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow
increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move
more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the
black hole.

                                        <span>  We study 3D $N=2$ supersymmetric field theories geometrically engineered from
M-theory on non-compact Calabi-Yau fourfolds (CY4). We establish a detailed
dictionary between the geometry and topology of non-compact CY4 and the physics
of 3D $N=2$ theories in three different regimes. The first one is the Coulomb
branch description when the CY4 is smooth. The second one is non-abelian gauge
theory when the CY4 has a degenerate $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration structure. The
third one is the strongly coupled SCFT from a CY4 singularity. We find
interesting flavor symmetry enhancements in the singular limit of CY4, as well
as an interesting and previously unexplored phenomenon in 3D, termed ``flavor
symmetry duality''. Many examples are analyzed with an emphasis on toric CY4s
and $\mathbb{C}^4$ orbifolds with crepant resolutions. We develop a new brane
box method to study the physics of Coulomb branch of 3D $N=2$ theory that
admits a toric construction. Via IIB/M-theory duality we find that the brane
box diagram living in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be physically realized as a
configuration of intersecting 4-branes which are extended objects in 8D maximal
supersymmetric theory, which is shown to be consistent via various chains of
dualities. The rank, effective gauge coupling and certain hints to flavor
symmetry enhancement of the 3D $N=2$ theory are read off from the brane box and
cross-checked against the results obtained from geometric engineering. The
exotic branes in 8D maximal supersymmetric theory and the 4-string junctions
thereof are shown to play a crucial role in the construction of the brane box.

i.e. the $X_{1,N}$ and the UV fixed point of the $SU(N+1)_0+2(N+1)$F gauge
theories. Their complete prepotentials are consistently constructed starting
from their weakly coupled description. The results are verified by employing UV
dualities and decoupling of flavors from theories with known complete
prepotentials. Applications of these results to the recent investigation of
non-supersymmetric conformal field theories from soft supersymmetric breaking
deformations are addressed.

                                        <span>  Considering an anisotropic cosmological background is an interesting and
simultaneously challenging problem of theoretical physics, since we not only
assume a high degree of anisotropy in the early stages of the Universe, but
also observe it to a small degree until now. In this paper we have constructed
the unconstrained action for the perturbations above Bianchi I type background
in the most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the Horndeski theory, and
evaluate the effect of the deviation from the anisotropic background on the
previously established stable solution obtained in previous works.

semiclassical ensembles of black hole microstates is recognized as the
Marchenko-Pastur distribution, which plays a prominent role as the universal
limit distribution in a large class of random matrix and vector models. It is
proposed that this distribution also universally determines the energy spectral
density of black holes, which allows to construct a Krylov space for the time
evolution of typical black hole states and calculate their state complexity. It
is checked that the state complexity growth at late times saturates Lloyd's
bound. Some implications of the proposed spectral density for the generation of
Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation are discussed.

quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so
leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The
area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless
limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation
group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions
suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the
renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in
scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the
increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in
entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed.
We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy
in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of
screening.

an evaporating black hole that is initially formed by a shock wave, taking into
account the quantum backreaction. Based on the holographic principle, along
with the assumption of a boundary equation of motion, we show that the black
hole energy is maintained for a while during the early stage of evaporation.
Gradually, it decreases as time goes on and eventually vanishes. Thus, the
Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the
emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and
reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes. It is also
shown that the maximum temperature of the evaporating black hole never exceeds
the Hawking temperature of the eternal AdS$_{2}$ black hole. We discuss
physical implications of the initial zero temperature of the evaporating black
hole.

central charge 24, or in physics parlance the purely left-moving, fermionic
2-dimensional conformal field theories with just one primary field.
  There are exactly 969 such vertex operator superalgebras under suitable
regularity assumptions (essentially strong rationality) and the assumption that
the shorter moonshine module $V\!B^\natural$ is the unique self-dual vertex
operator superalgebra of central charge 23.5 whose weight-1/2 and weight-1
spaces vanish. Additionally, there might be self-dual vertex operator
superalgebras arising as fake copies of $V\!B^\natural$ tensored with a free
fermion $F$.
  We construct and classify the self-dual vertex operator superalgebras by
determining the 2-neighbourhood graph of the self-dual vertex operator algebras
of central charge 24 and also by realising them as simple-current extensions of
a dual pair containing a certain maximal lattice vertex operator algebra. We
show that all vertex operator superalgebras besides $V\!B^\natural\otimes F$
and potential fake copies thereof stem from elements of the Conway group
$\mathrm{Co}_0$, the automorphism group of the Leech lattice $\Lambda$.
  By splitting off free fermions $F$, if possible, we obtain the classification
for all central charges less than or equal to 24.

topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase

first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in
systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as
second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence
of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase

order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects
in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be
predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

                                        <span>  We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by
analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the
entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum
models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly
entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground
states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we
reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic
divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established
super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where
the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz
matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of
a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the
entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this
pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We
provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights
into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights
gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the
logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the
Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the
entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on
the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.

                                        <span>  It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and
characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite
temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the
maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature,
suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are
gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we
study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled
SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both
perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the
empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with
the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating
state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various
limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory
of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full
solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible
representations.

                                        <span>  Quantum field theories can be applied to compute various statistical
properties of random tensors. In particular signed distributions of tensor
eigenvalues/vectors are the easiest, which can be computed as partition
functions of four-fermi theories. Though signed distributions are different
from genuine ones because of extra signs of weights, they are expected to
coincide in vicinities of ends of distributions. In this paper, we perform a
case study of the signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of the real symmetric
order-three random tensor. The correct critical point and the correct end in
the large $N$ limit are obtained from the four-fermi theory, for which a method
using the Schwinger-Dyson equation is very efficient. Since locations of ends
are particularly important in applications, such as the largest eigenvalues and
the best rank-one tensor approximations, signed distributions are the easiest
and highly useful through the Schwinger-Dyson method.

                                        <span>  We model backreaction in AdS$_2$ JT gravity via a proposed boundary dual
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dot coupled to Dirac fermion matter and study it from
the perspective of quantum entanglement and chaos. The boundary effective
action accounts for the backreaction through a linear coupling of the Dirac
fermions to the Gaussian-random two-body Majorana interaction term in the
low-energy limit. We calculate the time evolution of the entanglement entropy
between graviton and Dirac fermion fields for a separable initial state and
find that it initially increases and then saturates to a finite value.
Moreover, in the limit of a large number of fermions, we find a maximally
entangled state between the Majorana and Dirac fields in the saturation region,
implying a transition of the von Neumann algebra of observables from type I to
type II. This transition in turn indicates a loss of information in the
holographically dual emergent spacetime. We corroborate these observations with
a detailed numerical computation of the averaged nearest-neighbor gap ratio of
the boundary spectrum and provide a useful complement to quantum entanglement
studies of holography.

It was shown in arXiv:1602.06422 that OTOCs do not grow when the adjoint is
massless. We generalize the analysis of OTOCs to general nonzero masses $m > 0$
for the adjoint, where we give a new prescription for analytic continuation in
time such that we can evaluate OTOCs numerically using the retarded Green
function. Despite the fact that the behaviors of the two-point functions,
spectral density, and the Krylov complexity change drastically depending on
whether the adjoint is massless or not, in the parameter ranges we study, we do
not see the exponential growth of OTOCs for the massive adjoint cases. We end
with a discussion of the comparison of this model with the SYK model and
possible modification of the model.

extended by gauging the Maxwell algebra as well as the so called AdS-Maxwell
algebra. In this letter it is shown that the actions for these four-dimensional
extended Einstein gravities can be obtained from the five-dimensional
Chern-Simons gravities actions by using the Randall-Sundrum compactification
procedure. It is found that the In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction procedure, in the

from the AdS-Maxwell-Chern-Simons action and to obtain the Maxwell extension of
Einstein gravity in 4D from the four-dimensional extended
AdS-Maxwell-Einstein-Hilbert action. It is also shown that the extended
four-dimensional gravities belongs to the Horndeski family of scalar-tensor

IIA, represent D6 branes wrapped on spindles. A further circle uplift gives 11d

$Y^{p,q}$ manifolds. This highlights a connection between co-homogeneity one
Sasaki-Einstein metrics in general dimension and the recently introduced

also exists for the small resolution of the Calabi-Yau cone over such

                                        <span>  We consider the $(p+2)$-dimensional gauged supergravities arising as a
consistent truncation of type II on $S^{8-p}$, which are associated with the
near-horizon limit of D$p$-branes, for $p=2,4,5,6$ (and NS5-branes for $p=5$).
In a truncation of these theories with only abelian gauge fields and scalars,
we find several classes of new solutions, with and without supersymmetry. Our
ansatz for such backgrounds is inspired by the recent progress in the study of
branes wrapped on orbifolds, but unlike those examples we consider
"non-conformal branes", $i.e.$ no Anti de Sitter factors in the metric.
Focusing on cases with non-trivial gauge fields, we can divide the solutions
that we present in three categories: 1) branes wrapping Riemann surfaces,
spindles and disks, 2) branes wrapped on a circle with a holonomy for the gauge
field along the circle and 3) electrically charged black holes in gauged
supergravity, which uplift to rotating branes in ten dimensions. We carefully
analyze the conditions for supersymmetry in all these cases.

                                        <span>  This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants,
with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space.
The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on
models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic
compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the
galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction
with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in
effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave
signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a
phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects
using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo
satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental
constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite
clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event.
Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum
reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery
range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We
investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$
kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient
effects, has never been explored previously.

one constituent resembles a bare cosmological constant while the other emulates
a generalized Chaplygin gas, a good description of the Universe's large-scale
dynamics is obtained. In particular, our double polytropic reduces to the
Murnaghan equation of state, whose applications are already well established in
solid state physics and classical thermodynamics. Intriguingly, our model
approximates the conventional $\Lambda$CDM paradigm while reproducing the
collective effects of logotropic and generalized Chaplygin fluids across
different regimes. To check the goodness of our fluid description, we analyze
first order density perturbations, refining our model through various orders of
approximation, utilizing $\sigma_8$ data alongside other cosmological data
sets. Encouraging results suggest that our model, based on the Murnaghan
equation of state, outperforms the standard cosmological background within
specific approximate regimes and, on the whole, surpasses the standard
phenomenological reconstruction of dark energy.

minimal supergravity, we construct an exact solution characterizing non-BPS
charged rotating black holes with a horizon cross-section of a lens space
L(n;1). Among these solutions, only the ones corresponding to n=0 and n=1 do
not have any curvature singularities, conical singularities, Dirac-Misner
string singularities, and orbifold singularities both on and outside the
horizon; additionally, it is free from closed timelike curves. The solution for
n=0 corresponds to the charged dipole black ring that we constructed in the
previous paper. The specific solution for n=1, referred to as the ``capped
black hole," was introduced in our previous letter. This provides the first
example of a non-BPS exact solution, representing an asymptotically flat,
stationary spherical black hole with a domain of outer communication (DOC)
having a nontrivial topology in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We
demonstrate that the DOC on a timeslice has the topology of $[R^4\# CP^2
]\setminus B^4$. Differing from the well-known Myers-Perry and Cveti\v{c}-Youm
black holes describing a spherical horizon topology and a DOC with a trivial
topology of $R^4 \setminus B^4$ on a timeslice, the capped black hole's horizon
is capped by a disc-shaped bubble. We explicitly demonstrate that the capped
black hole carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a
magnetic flux, with only three of these quantities being independent.
Furthermore, we reveal that this black hole can possess identical conserved
charges as the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole. The existence of this solution
challenges black hole uniqueness beyond both the black ring and the BPS
spherical black hole. Moreover, within specific parameter regions, the capped
black hole can exhibit a larger entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.

of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the
velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as
the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the
monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in
addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected
with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While
the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even
increases with redshift.

                                        <span>  The Kerr spacetime is a fundamental solution of general relativity (GR),
describing the gravitational field around a rotating, uncharged black hole
(BH). Kerr spacetime has been crucial in modern astrophysics and it serves as a
foundation for the study of gravitational waves (GWs). Possible deviations in
Kerr geometry may indicate deviations from GR predictions. In this work, we
consider the Johannsen-Psaltis metric, which is a beyond-Kerr metric
characterized by a single free parameter, and then we probe this theory
framework using several GWs observations from the third Gravitational-wave
Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We find that, for most of the events analyzed,
there are no significant deviations from the null hypothesis, i.e. the Kerr
metric. Our main findings demonstrate alignment and certain enhancements when
compared to previous estimates documented in the literature.

                                        <span>  This article primarily investigates the existence of the charged compact star
under the conformal motion treatment within the context of f(Q) gravity. We
have developed two models by implementing the power-law and linear form of
conformal factor, enabling an in-depth comparison in our study. We have
selected the MIT Bag model equation of state to describe the connection between
pressure and energy density and matched the interior spherically symmetric
space-time with the Bardeen space-time. In addition, the present research
examines various physically valid characteristics of realistic stars, such as
PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and SMC X-1. We compare two
constructed models by attributing the behavior of density, pressure,
equilibrium conditions, and the adiabatic index. We have additionally included
a brief analysis of the scenario involving Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as an
external geometry for the matching condition. In contrast to the
Reissner-Nordstrom instance, the Bardeen model with the extra term in the
asymptotic representations yields a more intriguing and viable result. The
current analysis reveals that the resulting compact star solutions are
physically acceptable and authentic when considering the presence of charge
with conformal motion in f(Q) gravity.

                                        <span>  We explore the new physics phenomena of gravidynamics governed by the
inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry based on the gravitational quantum field
theory. Such a gravidynamics enables us to derive the generalized Einstein
equation and an equation beyond it. To simplify the analyses, we linearize the
dynamic equations of gravitational interaction by keeping terms up to the
leading order in the dual gravigauge field. We then apply the linearized
dynamic equations into two particular gravitational phenomena. First, we
consider the linearized equations in the absence of source fields, which is
shown to have five physical propagating polarizations as gravitational waves,
i.e., two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar, instead of two tensor
polarizations in the general relativity. Second, we examine the Newtonian limit
in which the gravitational fields and the matter source distribution are weak
and static. By deriving the associated Poisson equation, we obtain the exact
relation of the fundamental interaction coupling in the gravidynamics with the
experimentally measured Newtonian constant. We also make use of nonrelativistic
objects and relativistic photons to probe the Newtonian field configurations.
In particular, the experiments from the gravitational deflection of light rays
and the Shapiro time delay can place stringent constraints on the linearized
gravidynamics in the gravitational quantum field theory.

structure of the matter and the evolution of the universe. In this work we
study how the purely classical effect of accretion of fundamental fields onto
black holes can lead to shells of symmetry restoration in the midst of a
symmetry broken phase. We also show how it can catalyze vacuum decay, forming a
bubble that expands asymptotically at the speed of light. These effects offer
an alternative, purely classical mechanism to quantum tunnelling for seeding
phase transitions in the universe.

                                        <span>  We propose to adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in
order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to
physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge
transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and
analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of
the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in
terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling
solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow
equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we
discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory
in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient
of the kinetic term.

by a comparable mass-ratio black hole merger is modeled by the greybody factor
of the remnant black hole. Our model does not include fitting parameters except
for a single overall spectral amplitude. We perform the mass-spin inference
from the SXS data without introducing fitting parameters and without tuning the
data range of each SXS template. Also, we find that the exponential damping in
the ringdown spectral amplitude can be modeled well with the exponential
damping in the greybody factor at high frequencies. Based on the findings, we
propose a conjecture that the light ring of the remnant black hole, which
sources the ringdown, forms as early as during the merger stage. We discuss the
formation of the light ring in the static binary solution as a first step
towards the understanding of how the separation of merging black holes may
affect the formation of the light ring.

scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field,
which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically
symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m
solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including
derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two
asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial
infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To
understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field
equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types
of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence
of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important
role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of
different interactions at a large coupling limit.

                                        <span>  We employ double holography to examine a system of two entangled gravitating
universes that live on two codimension-one branes in an asymptotically AdS$_3$
spacetime with two disjoint conformal boundaries. There are distinct brane
configurations depending on the temperature of the thermofield double (TFD)
state between the left and right systems. The topology transition between two
branes is naturally identified with the emergence of an Einstein-Rosen bridge
connecting the two entangled universes. This doubly holographic construction
offers a holographic perspective on gravitational collapse and black hole
formation in brane universes. Through this holographic framework, we analyze
the quantum information structure of the two gravitating universes.
Specifically, we calculate the mutual information between defects present in
the boundary theories on the left and right sides. Furthermore, we investigate
the decoupling process in the Hayden-Preskill protocol applied to the two
copies of the defect field theory and discuss the interpretation of the
Yoshida-Kitaev decoding protocol.

have introduced an infinite class of novel gravitational observables in
Asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) space that reside on codimension-one or
-zero regions of the bulk spacetime. These observables encompass
well-established holographic complexity measures such as the maximum volume of
the extremal hypersurfaces and the action or spacetime volume of the
Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch. Furthermore, this family of observables exhibits
two universal properties when applied to the thermofield double (TFD) state:
they exhibit linear growth at late times and faithfully reproduce the
switchback effect. This implies that any observable from this class has the
potential to serve as a gravitational dual for the circuit complexity of
boundary states.

                                        <span>  The first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars
on the 17th of August, 2017, (GW170817) heralded the arrival of a new messenger
for probing neutron star astrophysics and provided the first constraints on
neutron star equation of state from gravitational wave observations.
Significant computational effort was expended to obtain these first results and
therefore, as observations of binary neutron star coalescence become more
routine in the coming observing runs, there is a need to improve the analysis
speed and flexibility. Here, we present a rapid approach for inferring the
neutron star equation of state based on Normalising Flows. As a demonstration,
using the same input data, our approach, ASTREOS, produces results consistent
with those presented by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration but requires < 1 sec to
generate neutron star equation of state confidence intervals. Furthermore,
ASTREOS allows for non-parametric equation of state inference. This rapid
analysis will not only facilitate neutron star equation of state studies but
can potentially enhance future alerts for electromagnetic follow-up
observations of binary neutron star mergers.

simple equation for the Hilbert and Noether energy-momentum tensors for the
scalar and electromagnetic field theories. We see that the two definitions of
energy-momentum tensors coincide and identify the Noether current if the
space-time has the Killing vector. Relation to the Wald entropy is also briefly

regular BH and traversable wormholes, and the deviation from Kerr BH. We found
that the rotating SV traversable wormhole spacetime has a closer innermost
stable circular orbit to the central object than Kerr and rotating regular BHs.
Furthermore, the paper provides the general form of the epicycle frequency in
this spacetime, presenting the radial profile of the angular frequency of
particles undergoing oscillatory motion. Unlike the commonly used $\chi$-square
analysis method, with considering a generalized data analysis approach in this
paper we hypothesize that the observational data of three microguasars can be
explained through an axisymmetric SV spacetime, fitting the data to find the
range of spin values for three types of SV objects, and analyzing the possible
mechanisms of HFQPOs (high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations) generation
for different types of axisymmetric SV objects. We found that for a Kerr BH
with $l^*=0$, the observational data of three microquasars can be explained by
the HFQPOs model used in this paper (excluding ER4 model); for a regular BH
with $l^*=1$, the HFQPO phenomenon observed through the three microquasars can
be explained by the ER0, ER1, ER2, ER3, RP0, RP1, RP2, TD and WD models. For a
traversable wormhole with $l^*=3$, the mechanism of HFQPO can be interpreted by
the ER1, ER3, RP0, RP1, RP2, TD and WD models. Moreover, we observed that for
the same HFQPOs model, the limiting range of the spin parameter $\alpha^*$
increases with the increase of the parameter $l^*$.

                                        <span>  We revisit static, spherically symmetric solutions to AdS-Einstein gravity
with a conformally coupled scalar field (and no self-interaction potential) in
four dimensions. We first observe that a convenient choice of coordinates leads
to a significant simplification of the field equations, which enables one to
identify various roots of the indicial equations and thus distinct branches of
solutions. Next, we construct an explicit 2-parameter hairy black hole solution
in terms of an infinite power series around the event horizon. The black hole
is non-extremal with a regular scalar field on and outside the event horizon,
and it reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS metric in the limit of vanishing hair.
Its properties are illustrated for various values of the parameters and
compared with previous numerical results by other authors. In addition, the
analysis reveals the presence of a photon sphere and how the scalar field
affects its size, in agreement with certain general bounds obtained in the
literature. The thermodynamics of the solution is also briefly discussed.

intertwiners. We first consider the entanglement introduced by the
group-averaging of the tensor-product type intertwiner on a four-valents
vertex. The result shows that the entanglement is determined by the probability
distribution of recoupling spin, and this probability distribution is a
well-behaved peak for the highest (and lowest) weight states. Further, we
calculated explicitly the entanglement on gauge-invariant coherent intertwiner
with four legs. Our numerical results show that the shape of the semiclassical
polyhedron described by the coherent intertwiner can be related to the
entanglement; In other words, the entanglement is controlled by the face-angle
of the semiclassical polyhedron. Finally, we extend our analytical calculation
to the coherent intertwiners with arbitrary number of legs.

fluid description near a Rindler horizon in Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the
Petrov classification that describes algebraic symmetries for Lorentzian
spaces, we establish an explicit mapping between a potential fluid and the
shockwave metric perturbation, where the Einstein equation for the shockwave
geometry is equivalent to the incompressibility condition of the fluid,
augmented by a shockwave source. Then we consider an Ansatz of a stochastic
quantum source for the potential fluid, which has the physical interpretation
of shockwaves created by vacuum energy fluctuations. Under such circumstance,
the Einstein equation, or equivalently, the incompressibility condition for the
fluid, becomes a stochastic differential equation. By smearing the quantum
source on a stretched horizon in a Lorentz invariant manner with a Planckian
width (similarly to the membrane paradigm), we integrate fluctuations near the
Rindler horizon to find an accumulated effect of the variance in the round-trip
time of a photon traversing the horizon of a causal diamond.

arising from the study of collinear limits of perturbative gravity amplitudes
in flat space. We explain from the twistor perspective how a non-vanishing
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ naturally modifies the celestial chiral
algebra. The cosmological constant deforms the Poisson bracket on twistor
space, so the corresponding deformed algebra of Hamiltonians under the new
bracket is automatically consistent. This algebra is equivalent to that
recently found by Taylor and Zhu. We find a number of variations of the
deformed algebra. We give the Noether charges arising from the expression of
this algebra as a symmetry of the twistor action for self-dual gravity with
cosmological constant.

5 dimensions that it is useful to reorganize the conventional thermodynamics on
the inner and outer horizons in terms of left- and right-moving variables. The
insight of arXiv:2310.13437 regarding the split of variables was loosely
inspired by the example of the BTZ black hole and the corresponding dual
CFT$_2$ thermodynamics governed by the Cardy formula. Here we revisit the BTZ
case and its generalizations in 3d gravity theories with higher derivative
corrections, and show formally the applicability of the newly defined variables
and their direct relation to the Cardy formula, which is not a priori

                                        <span>  Spins play a crucial role in the appearance, evolution and occupation
fraction of massive black holes. To date observational estimates of massive
black hole spins are scarce, and the assumptions commonly made in such
estimates have been recently questioned. Similarly, theoretical models for
massive black hole spin evolution, while reproducing the few observational
constraints, are based on possibly oversimplified assumptions. New independent
constraints on massive black hole spins are therefore of primary importance. We
present a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative orientation of radio
jets and mega-maser discs in ten low-redshift galaxies. We find a strong
preference for (partial) alignment between jets and mega-masers, that can be
attributed to two different causes: "coherent" and "selective" accretion. In
the first case the partial alignment is due to an anisotropy in the gas
reservoir fueling the growth of MBHs. In the second case the spin-dependent
anisotropic feedback allows for long-lived accretion only if the orbits of the
gas inflows are almost aligned to the MBH equatorial plane. A discussion of the
implications of the two accretion scenarios on the evolution of MBHs is
presented, together with an outlook on future observational tests aiming at
discriminating between the two scenarios and at checking if any of the two
apply to different redshifts and black hole mass regimes.

                                        <span>  We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative)
metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the
inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst
invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the
above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of
natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of
this type are shown to admit an explicit UV completion in a QCD-like theory
with a Planckian confining scale. Moreover, for these models, we find regions
of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most
recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the
$1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the
Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the
inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi
parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized
inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.

projective geometry provides a mathematically well-defined framework to discuss
their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate
singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act
isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce
projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on
correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and
projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their
expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes
their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on
space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We
explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the
irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey
spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework might be of use for
the consistent description of quantum fields in holographic correspondences and
their flat limits.

symmetric black holes, investigating photon spheres, shadows, emission rate and
quasinormal frequencies in relation to a parameter which triggers the Lorentz
symmetry breaking. We examine these configurations without and with the
presence of a cosmological constant. In the first scenario, the Lorentz
violation parameter, denoted as $\lambda$, plays a pivotal role in reducing
both the photon sphere and the shadow radius, while also leading to a damping
effect on quasinormal frequencies. Conversely, in the second scenario, as the
values of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) increase, we observe an
expansion in the shadow radius. Also, we provide the constraints of the shadows
based on the analysis observational data obtained from the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) focusing on Sagittarius $A^{*}$ shadow images. Additionally,
with the increasing $\Lambda$, the associated gravitational wave frequencies
exhibit reduced damping modes.

challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced
integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on
high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed
us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting
function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only
multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic
integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal -
cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell
condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the
post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to
the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.

the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For
example, tests of general relativity will become more accurate as smaller
deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed gravitational
waves becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with
each other, and a gravitational wave event presenting deviations from general
relativity could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how
phenomenological deviations from general relativity or binaries of exotic
compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event.
We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing and find that
certain phenomenological deviations from general relativity may be mistaken for
all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate
lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of
lensing where instead a deviation from general relativity has been seen.

                                        <span>  We consider Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system forced to move on a
submanifold $G_\alpha(q^A)=0$. If for some reasons we are interested in knowing
the dynamics of all original variables $q^A(t)$, the most economical would be a
Hamiltonian formulation on the intermediate phase-space submanifold spanned by
reducible variables $q^A$ and an irreducible set of momenta $p_i$,
$[i]=[A]-[\alpha]$. We describe and compare two different possibilities for
establishing the Poisson structure and Hamiltonian dynamics on an intermediate
submanifold: Hamiltonian reduction of the Dirac bracket and intermediate
formalism. As an example of the application of intermediate formalism, we
deduce on this basis the Euler-Poisson equations of a spinning body, establish
the underlying Poisson structure, and write their general solution in terms of
the exponential of the Hamiltonian vector field.

                                        <span>  We examine the motion of the massless scalar field and nearly bound null
geodesics in the near-ring region of a black hole, which may possess either
acceleration or a gravitomagnetic mass. Around such black holes, the photon
ring deviates from the equatorial plane. In the large angular momentum limit,
we demonstrate that the massless scalar field exhibits an emergent conformal
symmetry in this near-ring region. Additionally, in the nearly bound limit, we
observe the emergence of a conformal symmetry for the null geodesics that
constitute the photon ring in the black hole image. These findings suggest that
the hidden conformal symmetry, associated with the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{s
l}(2, \mathbb{R})$, persists even for black holes lacking north-south
reflection symmetry, thereby broadening the foundation of photon ring
holography. Finally, we show that the conformal symmetry also emerges for
nearly bound timelike geodesics and scalar fields in proximity to the particle
ring, and with specific mass around a Schwarzschild black hole.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we explore the prospect for improving the measurement accuracy
of masses and radii of neutron stars. We consider imminent and long-term
upgrades of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and
Virgo, as well as next-generation observatories -- the Cosmic Explorer and
Einstein Telescope. We find that neutron star radius with single events will be
constrained to within roughly 500m with the current generation of detectors and
their upgrades. This will improve to 200m, 100m and 50m with a network of
observatories that contain one, two or three next-generation observatories,
respectively. Combining events in bins of 0.05 solar masses we find that for
stiffer (softer) equations-of-state like ALF2 (APR4), a network of three XG
observatories will determine the radius to within 30m (100m) over the entire
mass range of neutron stars from 1 to 2.0 solar masses (2.2 solar masses),
allowed by the respective equations-of-state. Neutron star masses will be
measured to within 0.5 percent with three XG observatories irrespective of the
actual equation-of-state. Measurement accuracies will be a factor of 4 or 2
worse if the network contains only one or two XG observatories, respectively,
and a factor of 10 worse in the case of networks consisting of Advanced LIGO,
Virgo KAGRA and their upgrades. Tens to hundreds of high-fidelity events
detected by future observatories will allow us to accurately measure the
mass-radius curve and hence determine the dense matter equation-of-state to
exquisite precision.

                                        <span>  We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a
warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a
(few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale
$\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the
TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter
$\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi<\rho_1$, is localized in the dark
brane. The radion, with mass $m_r<m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim
m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim
m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic
conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic
abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The
former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter
by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast
range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is
achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane
with $\rho_1\lesssim 10$~GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase
transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational
waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the
signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA
window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 2$ GeV the relic
abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.

                                        <span>  In this letter, we propose a new generalized mass-to-horizon relation to be
used in the context of entropic cosmologies and holographic principle
scenarios. We show that a general scaling of the mass with the Universe horizon
as $M=\gamma \frac{c^2}{G}L^n$ leads to a new generalized entropy $S_n = \gamma
\frac{n}{1+n}\frac{2 \pi\,k_B\,c^3}{G\,\hbar} L^{n+1}$ from which we can
recover many of the recently proposed forms of entropies at cosmological and
black hole scales and also establish a thermodynamically consistent relation
between each of them and Hawking temperature. We analyse the consequences of
introducing this new mass-to-horizon relation on cosmological scales by
comparing the corresponding modified Friedmann, acceleration, and continuity
equations to cosmological data. We find that when $n=3$, the entropic cosmology
model is fully and totally equivalent to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, thus
providing a new fundamental support for the origin and the nature of the
cosmological constant. In general, if $\log \gamma < -3$, and irrespective of
the value of $n$, we find a very good agreement with the data comparable with
$\Lambda$CDM from which, in Bayesian terms, our models are indistinguishable.

black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing
method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the
electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background
spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow
increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move
more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the
black hole.

                                        <span>  Black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime provide an important testing ground
for both gravitational and field-theoretic phenomena. In particular, the study
of perturbations can be useful to further our understanding regarding certain
physical processes, such as superradiance, or the dynamics of strongly coupled
conformal field theories through the holographic principle. In this work we
continue our systematic study of the ultraviolet instabilities of black-hole
quasinormal modes, built on the characterization of the latter as eigenvalues
of a (spectrally unstable) non-selfadjoint operator and using the
pseudospectrum as a main analysis tool, extending our previous studies in the
asymptotically flat setting to Anti-de Sitter asymptotics. Very importantly,
this step provides a singularly well-suited probe into some of the key
structural aspects of the pseudospectrum. This is a consequence of the specific
features of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter geometry, together with the
existence of a sound characterization by Warnick of quasinormal modes as
eigenvalues, that is still absent in asymptotic flatness. This work focuses on
such structural aspects, with an emphasis on the convergence issues of the
pseudospectrum and, in particular, the comparison between the hyperboloidal and
null slicing cases. As a physical by-product of this structural analysis we
assess, in particular, the spectral stability of purely imaginary
``hydrodynamic" modes, which appear for axial gravitational perturbations, that
become dominant when the black-hole horizon is larger than the anti-de Sitter
radius. We find that their spectral stability, under perturbations, depends on
how close they are to the real axis, or conversely how distant they are from
the first oscillatory overtone.

                                        <span>  Peculiar velocity encodes rich information about the formation, dynamics,
evolution, and merging history of binary black holes. In this work, we employ a
hierarchical Bayesian model to infer the peculiar velocity distribution of
binary black holes. We use the data from GWTC-3 and assume a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution for the peculiar velocities, but do not consider the dependence of
peculiar velocity on the masses of black hole binaries. The constraint on the
peculiar velocity distribution parameter, $v_0$, is weak and uninformative.
However, the determination of peculiar velocity distribution can be
significantly improved with next-generation ground-based gravitational wave
detectors. For the Einstein Telescope, the relative uncertainty of $v_0$ will
reduce to $\sim$ 10\% using $10^3$ golden binary black hole events. Our
statistical approach thus provides a robust and prospective inference for
determining the peculiar velocity distribution.

simultaneously challenging problem of theoretical physics, since we not only
assume a high degree of anisotropy in the early stages of the Universe, but
also observe it to a small degree until now. In this paper we have constructed
the unconstrained action for the perturbations above Bianchi I type background
in the most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the Horndeski theory, and
evaluate the effect of the deviation from the anisotropic background on the
previously established stable solution obtained in previous works.

semiclassical ensembles of black hole microstates is recognized as the
Marchenko-Pastur distribution, which plays a prominent role as the universal
limit distribution in a large class of random matrix and vector models. It is
proposed that this distribution also universally determines the energy spectral
density of black holes, which allows to construct a Krylov space for the time
evolution of typical black hole states and calculate their state complexity. It
is checked that the state complexity growth at late times saturates Lloyd's
bound. Some implications of the proposed spectral density for the generation of
Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation are discussed.

collaboration has reopened the hunt for gravitational-wave (GW) signals, with
one compact-binary-coalescence (CBC) signal expected to be observed every few
days. Among the signals that could be detected for the first time there is the
stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from the superposition of
unresolvable GW signals that cannot be detected individually. In fact, multiple
SGWBs are likely to arise given the variety of sources, making it crucial to
identify the dominant components and assess their origin. However, most search
methods with ground-based detectors assume the presence of one SGWB component
at a time, which could lead to biased results in estimating its spectral shape
if multiple SGWBs exist. Therefore, a joint estimate of the components is
necessary. In this work, we adapt such an approach and analyse the data from
the first three LVK observing runs, searching for a multi-component isotropic
SGWB. We do not find evidence for any SGWB and establish upper limits on the
dimensionless energy parameter $\Omega_{\rm gw}(f)$ at 25 Hz for five different
power-law spectral indices, $\alpha = 0, \, 2/3,\, 2,\, 3,\, 4$, jointly. For
the spectral indices $\alpha = 2/3,\, 2, \, 4$, corresponding to astrophysical
SGWBs from CBCs, r-mode instabilities in young rotating neutron stars, and
magnetars, we draw further astrophysical implications by constraining the
ensemble parameters $K_{\rm CBC}, \, K_{\rm r-modes}, \, K_{\rm magnetars}$,
defined in the main text.

                                        <span>  In a dilaton gravity model, we revisit the calculation of the temperature of
an evaporating black hole that is initially formed by a shock wave, taking into
account the quantum backreaction. Based on the holographic principle, along
with the assumption of a boundary equation of motion, we show that the black
hole energy is maintained for a while during the early stage of evaporation.
Gradually, it decreases as time goes on and eventually vanishes. Thus, the
Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the
emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and
reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes. It is also
shown that the maximum temperature of the evaporating black hole never exceeds
the Hawking temperature of the eternal AdS$_{2}$ black hole. We discuss
physical implications of the initial zero temperature of the evaporating black
hole.

                                        <span>  The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and
topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase
transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and
condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing
first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in
systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as
second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence
of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase
transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second
order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects
in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be
predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

                                        <span>  It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and
characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite
temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the
maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature,
suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are
gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we
study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled
SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both
perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the
empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with
the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating
state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various
limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory
of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full
solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible
representations.

system in free-fall around a gravitating body {\it e.g.} a satellite orbiting
the Earth. Since the system is in free-fall, by the equivalence principle, the
quantum system is locally in flat, gravity-free space-time - it is screened
from the gravitational field. For a slightly elliptical orbit, the
gravitational potential will change with time. This leads to the energy levels
of the quantum system developing side bands which is the signature for this
version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This contrasts with the normal signature
of the Aharonov-Bohm effect of shifting of interference fringes.

                                        <span>  Adiabatic binary inspiral in the small mass ratio limit treats the small body
as moving along a geodesic of a large Kerr black hole, with the geodesic slowly
evolving due to radiative backreaction. Up to initial conditions, geodesics are
typically parameterized in two ways: using the integrals of motion energy $E$,
axial angular momentum $L_z$, and Carter constant $Q$; or, using orbit geometry
parameters semi-latus rectum $p$, eccentricity $e$, and (cosine of )
inclination $x_I \equiv \cos I$. The community has long known how to compute
orbit integrals as functions of the orbit geometry parameters, i.e., as
functions expressing $E(p, e, x_I)$, and likewise for $L_z$ and $Q$. Mappings
in the other direction -- functions $p(E, L_z, Q)$, and likewise for $e$ and
$x_I$ -- have not yet been developed in general. In this note, we develop
generic mappings from ($E$, $L_z$, $Q$) to ($p$, $e$, $x_I$). The mappings are
particularly simple for equatorial orbits ($Q = 0$, $x_I = \pm1$), and can be
evaluated efficiently for generic cases. These results make it possible to more
accurately compute adiabatic inspirals by eliminating the need to use a
Jacobian which becomes singular as inspiral approaches the last stable orbit.

inspiraling binary whose center-of-mass undergoes a small acceleration, assumed
to be constant during the detection, such as when it orbits a distant tertiary
mass. The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated
as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the
wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It
is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the
low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good
sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect.
We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of
this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope
over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss
degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters. We also determine the
parameter space where the acceleration is large enough that the wave phase
model would have to be extended to nonlinear orders in the acceleration.

out the hypothesis that the gap between the inclusive $B\rightarrow X\ell\nu$

by $B\rightarrow D^{(\ast)} \eta \ell \nu$ decays.

                                        <span>  We present a method to compute lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of
heavy meson within heavy quark effective theory (HQET). Our method utilizes
quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) with a large momentum component
$P^z$. We point out that by sequentially integrating out $P^z$ and $m_H$, one
can disentangle different dynamical scales. Integrating out $P^z$ allows to
connect quasi-DAs to QCD LCDAs, and then integrating out $m_H$ enables to
relate QCD LCDAs to HQET LCDAs. To verify this proposal, we make use of lattice
QCD simulation on a lattice ensemble with spacing $a = 0.05187$\,fm. The
preliminary findings for HQET LCDAs qualitatively align with phenomenological
models. Using a recent model for HQET LCDAs, we also fit the first inverse
moment $\lambda_B^{-1}$ and the result is consistent with the experimentally
constrain from $B \to \gamma \ell\nu_\ell$. This agreement demonstrates the
promise of our method in providing first-principle predictions for heavy meson
LCDAs.

inhomogeneous phase in rigidly rotating $N_c = 3$ gluon plasma. This mixed
phase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal
equilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase
transition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within
a few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our
results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking
of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the
confining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.

a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase
transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte
Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm
numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation
of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative
moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the
negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic
Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular
momentum of rotating plasma thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take
negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.

flavor-changing-charged current $b\rightarrow c\tau\overline{\nu}_{\tau}$

branching ratio of $B_{c}\to\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$, we analyze the parametric

purview of the most recent HFLAV data of $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right)$,
$R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right)$ and Belle data of $F_{L}\left(D^*\right)$
and $P_{\tau}\left(D^*\right)$. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules which
correlate these observables with $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right)$ and
$R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right)$. Using the best-fit points of the new
complex WCs along with the latest measurements of
$R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right)$, we predict the numerical values of the
observable $R_{\tau/\ell}\left(\Lambda_c\right)$,
$R_{\tau/\mu}\left(J/\psi\right)$ and $R_{\tau/\ell}\left(X_c\right)$ from the
sum rules. Apart from finding the correlation matrix among the observables
under consideration, we plot them graphically which is useful to discriminate
different NP scenarios. Finally, we study the impact of these NP couplings on
various angular and the CP triple product asymmetries, that could be measured
in some ongoing and future experiments. The precise measurements of these
observables are important to check the SM and extract the possible NP.

multiquark states, we systematically study their electromagnetic properties. In
this study, the magnetic and quadrupole moments of the theoretically predicted
singly-charmed state with the quantum numbers $\mathrm{J^P = 1^+}$ is
investigated within the framework of the QCD light-cone sum rules method by
considering the diquark-antidiquark configuration of this state with quark
contents $[ud][\bar{c}\bar{s}]$. The predicted results for the magnetic and
quadrupole moments are as $\mu_{\mathrm{X_{AV}}}=-0.89 ^{+0.14}_{-0.12}~\mu_N $
and $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{X_{AV}}} = (-0.46 ^{+0.07}_{-0.06})\times 10^{-2}
~\mbox{fm}^2$. The results obtained can be useful in determining the exact
nature of this state. This work will hopefully stimulate experimental interest
in the study of the electromagnetic properties of multiquark systems.

                                        <span>  We calculate the mass spectrum of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark systems $
QQ\bar Q\bar Q~(Q=c,b) $ with both normal $ (J^{PC}=0^{++},1^{+-},2^{++}) $ and
exotic $ (J^{PC}=0^{+-},1^{++},2^{+-}) $ C-parities using three different quark
potential models (AL1, AP1, BGS). The exotic C-parity systems refer to the ones
that cannot be composed of two S-wave ground heavy quarkonia. We incorporate
the molecular dimeson and compact diquark-antidiquark spatial correlations
simultaneously, thereby discerning the actual configurations of the states. We
employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger
equation, and the complex scaling method to identify the resonant states. The
mass spectra in three different models qualitatively agree with each other. We
obtain several resonant states with $ J^{PC} = 0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++}, 1^{++} $
in the mass region $(6.92,7.30)\, \mathrm{GeV}$, some of which are good
candidates of the experimentally observed $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$. We also
obtain several exotic C-parity zero-width states with $ J^{PC}=0^{+-} $ and $
2^{+-} $. These zero-width states have no corresponding S-wave diquarkonium
threshold and can only decay strongly to final states with P-wave quarkonia.
With the notation $T_{4Q,J(C)}(M)$, we deduce from the root mean square radii
that the $ X(7200) $ candidates $ T_{4c,0(+)}(7173), T_{4c,2(+)}(7214) $ and
the state $ T_{4c,1(-)}(7191) $ look like molecular states although most of the
resonant and zero-width states are compact states.

state with Cooper pairs carrying the same quantum number as pions. I solve the
gap equation derived from the perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading
order corrections. The pairing gap at large isospin chemical potential is found
to be enhanced compared to the color-superconducting gap at large baryon
chemical potential due to the $\sqrt{2}$ difference in the exponent arising
from the stronger attraction in one-gluon exchange in the singlet channel.
Then, using the gap function, I evaluate the contribution of the condensation
energy of the superfluid state to the QCD equation of state. At isospin
chemical potential of a few GeV, where the lattice QCD and the perturbative QCD
can be both applied, the effect of the condensation energy becomes dominant
even compared to the next-to-leading order corrections to the pressure in the
perturbation theory. It resolves the discrepancy between the recent lattice QCD
results and the perturbative QCD result.

                                        <span>  Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as
metrology and simulating many-body physics. Recent research has proposed
utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with
potentially logical lifetimes on the order of seconds via enhanced collective
interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin
cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed
`parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing': odd cat states are significantly
more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing compared to even cat states due to
parity symmetry. Additionally, from a mean-field analysis of the
driven-dissipative dynamics, we identify a synchronization phase transition
wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical
inhomogeneous linewidth. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective
spin states, important for advancing quantum technologies.

                                        <span>  Laser light possesses perfect coherence, but cannot be attenuated to single
photons via linear optics. An elegant route to convert laser light into single
photons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the
strong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this
method remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach
where laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively
interfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a
cavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by
measuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided
optical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the
Purcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving
field with the cavity output field. We achieve the second-order autocorrelation
g2(0)=0.030+-0.002 and the two-photon interference visibility 94.3%+-0.2. By
separating the coherent and incoherent fields in the reflected light, we
observe that the incoherent field from the cavity exhibits super-bunching with
g2(0)=41+-2 while the coherent field remains Poissonian statistics. By
controlling the relative amplitude of coherent and incoherent fields, we verify
that photon statistics of reflected light is tuneable from perfect
anti-bunching to super-bunching in agreement with our predictions. Our results
demonstrate photon statistics of light as a quantum interference phenomenon
that a single QD can scatter two photons simultaneously at low driving fields
in contrast to the common picture that a single two-level quantum emitter can
only scatter (or absorb and emit) single photons. This work opens the door to
tailoring photon statistics of laser light via cavity or waveguide quantum
electrodynamics and interference.

Advanced ionization equilibrium models have been added for low charge states of
seven elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si and S), and represent a significant
improvement especially when modelling the solar transition region. The models
include the effects of higher electron density and charge transfer on
ionization and recombination rates. As an illustration of the difference these
models make, a synthetic spectrum is calculated for an electron pressure of
7$\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ K and compared with an active region observation
from HRTS. Increases are seen of factors of two to five in the predicted
radiances of the strongest lines in the UV from Si IV, C IV, and N V, compared
to the previous modelling using the coronal approximation. Much better
agreement (within 20\%) with the observation is found for the majority of the
lines. The new atomic models better equip both those who are studying the
transition region and those who are interpreting emission from higher density
astrophysical and laboratory plasma. In addition to the advanced models,
several ion datasets have been added or updated, and data for the radiative
recombination energy loss rate have been updated.

                                        <span>  The interplay of kinetic electron physics and atomic processes in ultrashort
laser-plasma interactions provides a comprehensive understanding of electron
energy distribution's impact on plasma properties. Notably, non-equilibrium
electrons play a vital role in collisional ionization, influencing ionization
degrees and spectra. This paper introduces a computational model that
integrates the physics of kinetic electrons and atomic processes, utilizing a
Boltzmann equation for non-equilibrium electrons and a collisional-radiative
model for atomic state populations. The model is used to investigate the
influence of non-equilibrium electrons on collisional ionization rates and
their effect on population distribution, as demonstrated by L. Young et al.
(Nature, 2010). The study reveals significant non-equilibrium electron presence
during XFEL-matter interactions, profoundly affecting collisional ionization
rates in the gas plasma, thereby necessitating careful consideration of the
Collisional-Radiative (CR) model applied to such systems.

flipper in between. The Frisch and Segr\`e experiment has been modeled
analytically by Majorana without the nuclear effect and subsequently revised by
Rabi with the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do
not match the experimental observation accurately. Here, we numerically solve
the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, including
the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. Thus far, the
coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model
without using free parameters are still low, indicating a mismatch between the
theory and the experiment. Non-standard variants that improve the match are
explored for discussion.

map subterranean mass and density anomalies. There is a broad diversification
regarding the working principle of gravimeters, wherein atomic gravimeters are
one of the most technologically progressive class of gravimeters which can
monitor gravity at an absolute scale with a high-repetition without exhibiting
drift. Despite the apparent utility for geophysical surveys, atomic gravimeters
are (currently) laboratory-bound devices due to the vexatious task of
transportation. Here, we demonstrated the utility of an atomic gravimeter
on-site during a gravity survey, where the issue of immobility was circumvented
with a relative spring gravimeter. The atomic gravimeter served as a means to
map the relative data from the spring gravimeter to an absolute measurement
with an effective precision of 7.7$\mu$Gal. Absolute measurements provide a
robust and feasible method to define and control gravity data taken at
different sites, or a later date, which is critical to analyze underground
geological units, in particular when it is combined with other geophysical
approaches.

are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance
engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high
accuracy in shallow quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel
quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with mirror
symmetry using matrix product states. By considering mirror symmetry, our
method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the
accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved
the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix
product states. Our approach, characterized by a shallow quantum circuit
primarily comprising nearest-neighbor qubit gates and linear scalability with
qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our
experimental findings reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks
depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of
qubits. Our method is experimentally demonstrated for a normal distribution
encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.

                                        <span>  In periodically driven (Floquet) systems, evolution typically results in an
infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption over
time. However, before reaching thermal equilibrium, such systems may
transiently pass through a meta-stable state known as a prethermal state. This
prethermal state can exhibit phenomena not commonly observed in equilibrium,
such as discrete time crystals (DTCs), making it an intriguing platform for
exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the relaxation
dynamics of initially prepared product states under periodic driving in a
kicked Ising model using the IBM Quantum Heron processor, comprising 133
superconducting qubits arranged on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, over up to $100$
time steps. We identify the presence of a prethermal regime characterised by
magnetisation measurements oscillating at twice the period of the Floquet cycle
and demonstrate its robustness against perturbations to the transverse field.
Our results provide evidence supporting the realisation of a period-doubling
DTC in a two-dimensional system. Moreover, we discover that the longitudinal
field induces additional amplitude modulations in the magnetisation with a
period incommensurate with the driving period, leading to the emergence of
discrete time quasicrystals (DTQCs). These observations are further validated
through comparison with tensor-network and state-vector simulations. Our
findings not only enhance our understanding of clean DTCs in two dimensions but
also highlight the utility of digital quantum computers for simulating the
dynamics of quantum many-body systems, addressing challenges faced by
state-of-the-art classical simulations.

                                        <span>  We explore a very simple distribution of unitaries: random (binary) phase --
Hadamard -- random (binary) phase -- random computational-basis permutation. We
show that this distribution is statistically indistinguishable from random Haar
unitaries for any polynomial set of orthogonal input states (in any basis) with
polynomial multiplicity. This shows that even though real-valued unitaries
cannot be completely pseudorandom (Haug, Bharti, Koh, arXiv:2306.11677), we can
still obtain some pseudorandom properties without giving up on the simplicity
of a real-valued unitary.
  Our analysis shows that an even simpler construction: applying a random
(binary) phase followed by a random computational-basis permutation, would
suffice, assuming that the input is orthogonal and \emph{flat} (that is, has
high min-entropy when measured in the computational basis).
  Using quantum-secure one-way functions (which imply quantum-secure
pseudorandom functions and permutations), we obtain an efficient cryptographic
instantiation of the above.

                                        <span>  We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method
for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The
method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms
with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it
obtains numerically exact real-time Green's functions without sampling noises,
it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its
computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale
with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature
equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact
solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO
calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state
of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent
particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying
steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient
real-time impurity solver in quantum embedding methods such as the dynamical
mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.

                                        <span>  In this work, we give a new variational quantum algorithm for solving
electronic structure problems of molecules using only linear quantum optical
systems. The variational ansatz we proposed is a hybrid of non-interacting
Boson dynamics and classical computational chemistry methods, specifically, the
Hartree-Fock method and the Configuration Interaction method. The Boson part is
built by a linear optical interferometer which is easier to realize compared
with the well-known Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz composed of quantum
gates in conventional VQE and the classical part is merely classical processing
acting on the Hamiltonian. We called such ansatzes Boson Sampling-Classic
(BS-C). The appearance of permanents in the Boson part has its physical
intuition to provide different kinds of resources from commonly used single-,
double-, and higher-excitations in classical methods and the UCC ansatz to
exploring chemical quantum states. Such resources can help enhance the accuracy
of methods used in the classical parts. We give a scalable hybrid homodyne and
photon number measurement procedure for evaluating the energy value which has
intrinsic abilities to mitigate photon loss errors and discuss the extra
measurement cost induced by the no Pauli exclusion principle for Bosons with
its solutions. To demonstrate our proposal, we run numerical experiments on
several molecules and obtain their potential energy curves reaching chemical
accuracy.

computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex
optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional
driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in
spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate
in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising
Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior
performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating
its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes.
Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's
proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent
gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization
in physical systems.

time, can be induced if the quantum system depends on a continuous parameter.
The evolution in the emergent evolution dimension is described by a parallel
transport, the closest fiber bundle analog to a geodesic in (pseudo-)Riemannian
geometry. Nevertheless, the evolution in the emergent dimension often exhibits
some singular behaviors at critical points. In this work, we demonstrate that
these singularities can be indications of quantum phase transitions. We then
show that these singularities, like those at the black hole event horizon, can
be removed locally.

                                        <span>  Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as
metrology and simulating many-body physics. Recent research has proposed
utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with
potentially logical lifetimes on the order of seconds via enhanced collective
interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin
cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed
`parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing': odd cat states are significantly
more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing compared to even cat states due to
parity symmetry. Additionally, from a mean-field analysis of the
driven-dissipative dynamics, we identify a synchronization phase transition
wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical
inhomogeneous linewidth. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective
spin states, important for advancing quantum technologies.

                                        <span>  Pure states are an important resource in many quantum information processing
protocols. However, even making a fixed pure state, say $|0\rangle$, in the
laboratory requires a considerable amount of effort. Often one ends up with a
mixed state $\rho$ whose classical description is nevertheless known. Hence it
is important to develop protocols that extract a fixed pure state from a known
mixed state. In this work, we study the problem of extracting a fixed pure
state $|0\rangle^{A'} |0\rangle^{B'}$ from a known pure state $\rho^{AB}$
distributed between two parties $A$ and $B$. Here, $A'$, $B'$ are subspaces of
$A$, $B$ and the total amount of purity extracted is $\log |A'| + \log |B'|$.
The parties can borrow local pure ancilla, apply local unitary operations and
send a message from $A$ to $B$ through a dephasing channel. If local pure
ancilla is borrowed, it must be subtracted in order to properly account for the
purity extracted. We obtain the most efficient achievable bounds on one shot
distributed purity extraction, in terms of the rate of local ancilla borrowed
by the protocol, while distilling pure qubits at the best known rate. Our
protocols borrow little to no local pure ancilla. Our bounds improve upon the
existing bounds for this problem in both one shot as well as asymptotic iid
settings. In particular they subsume all the asymptotic iid results of Devetak
and Krovi-Devetak. In addition, we derive upper bounds for the rate of
distillation in the one shot setting, which nearly match our achievable bounds.

are dispersively coupled to high quality-factor cavities, characteristic
functions of cavity states can be directly probed with echoed conditional
displacement (ECD) gates. In this work, I propose a method to certify
non-Gaussian entanglement between cavities using only ECD gates and qubit
readouts. The ECD witness arises from an application of Bochner's theorem to a
surprising connection between two negativities: that of the reduced Wigner
function, and that of the partial transpose. Non-Gaussian entanglement of some
common states, like photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacua and entangled
cats, can be detected by measuring as few as four points of the characteristic
function. Furthermore, the expectation value of the witness is a simultaneous
lower bound to the Wigner negativity volume and a geometric measure of
entanglement conjectured to be the partial transpose negativity. Both
negativities are strong monotones of non-Gaussianity and entanglement
respectively, so the ECD witness provides experimentally-accessible lower
bounds to quantities related to these monotones without the need for tomography
on the cavity states.

variational quantum computing to nonlinear physics and fluid dynamics. In this
work, we employ this algorithm to find the ground state of the nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a quadratic potential and implement it on the
cloud superconducting quantum processors. We analyze the expressivity of
real-amplitude ansatz to capture the ground state of the nonlinear system
across various interaction regimes characterized by varying strengths of
nonlinearity. Our investigation reveals that although quantum hardware noise
impairs the evaluation of the energy cost function, small instances of the
problem consistently converge to the ground state. We implement a variety of
problem instances on IBM Q devices and report analogous discrepancies in the
energy cost function evaluation attributable to quantum hardware noise. The
latter are absent in the state fidelity estimation. Our comprehensive analysis
offers valuable insights into the practical implementation and advancement of
the variational algorithms for nonlinear quantum dynamics.

collision of an intense spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulse carrying
intrinsic TOAM with a high-energy electron beam. It is found that the TOAM of
STOV pulse remains almost unchanged, and the TOAM is conserved in the
center-of-mass frame (CMF). Moreover, there exhibits duality for particles TOAM
in the CMF and laboratory frame (LF) when the initial location of high-energy
electron beam is different. Furthermore, the TOAM of $\gamma$-photons in the
CMF increases while that of positrons decreases as the topological charge of
STOV pulse increases, whereas in the LF, the TOAM of both $\gamma$-photons and
positrons decreases. And the result under the same pulse intensity is better
than that under the same pulse energy. The increase in the initial energy of
high-energy electrons leads to an enhancement of the TOAM for both

challenges. Here, we demonstrate that a network-wide synergistic usage of
quantum memories distributed in a quantum communication network offers a
fundamental advantage. We first map the problem of quantum communication with
local usage of memories into a classical continuum percolation model. Then, we
show that this mapping can be improved through a cooperation of entanglement
distillation and relay protocols via remote access to distributed memories.
This improved mapping, which we term $\alpha$-percolation, can be formulated in
terms of graph-merging rules, analogous to the decimation rules of the
renormalization group treatment of disordered quantum magnets. These rules can
be performed in any order, yielding the same optimal result, which is
characterized by the emergence of a ``positive feedback'' mechanism and the
formation of spatially disconnected ``hopping'' communication components --
both marking significant improvements in quantum network connectivity.

                                        <span>  Quantum steering refers to the apparent possibility of exploiting
nonseparable quantum correlations to remotely influence the quantum state of an
observer via local measurements. Different from entanglement and Bell
nonlocality, quantum steering exhibits an inherent asymmetric property, which
makes it relevant for many asymmetric quantum information processing tasks.
Here, we study Gaussian quantum steering between two mechanical modes in an
optomechanical ring cavity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we show
that the state of the two considered modes can exhibit two-way steering and
even one-way steering. Instead of using unbalanced losses or noises, we propose
a simple practical way to control the direction of one-way steering. A
comparative study between the steering and entanglement of the studied modes
shows that both steering and entanglement undergo a sudden death-like behavior.
In particular, steering is found more fragile against thermal noise remaining
constantly upper bounded by entanglement. The proposed scheme may be meaningful

of such protocol depends fundamentally on the direction of steering.

entanglement can be precisely defined, but only negatively. In this article, we

                                        <span>  We develop a constructive approach to generate quantum neural networks
capable of representing the exact thermal states of all many-body qubit
Hamiltonians. The Trotter expansion of the imaginary-time propagator is
implemented through an exact block encoding by means of a unitary, restricted
Boltzmann machine architecture. Marginalization over the hidden-layer neurons
(auxiliary qubits) creates the non-unitary action on the visible layer. Then,
we introduce a unitary deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which the
hidden-layer qubits are allowed to couple laterally to other hidden qubits. We
prove that this wave function ansatz is closed under the action of the
imaginary-time propagator and, more generally, can represent the action of a
universal set of quantum gate operations. We provide analytic expressions for
the coefficients for both architectures, thus enabling exact network
representations of thermal states without stochastic optimization of the
network parameters. In the limit of large imaginary time, the ansatz yields the
ground state of the system. The number of qubits grows linearly with the system
size and total imaginary time for a fixed interaction order. Both networks can
be readily implemented on quantum hardware via mid-circuit measurements of
auxiliary qubits. If only one auxiliary qubit is measured and reset, the
circuit depth scales linearly with imaginary time and system size, while the
width is constant. Alternatively, one can employ a number of auxiliary qubits
linearly proportional to the system size, and circuit depth grows linearly with
imaginary time only.

                                        <span>  Laser light possesses perfect coherence, but cannot be attenuated to single
photons via linear optics. An elegant route to convert laser light into single
photons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the
strong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this
method remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach
where laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively
interfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a
cavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by
measuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided
optical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the
Purcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving
field with the cavity output field. We achieve the second-order autocorrelation
g2(0)=0.030+-0.002 and the two-photon interference visibility 94.3%+-0.2. By
separating the coherent and incoherent fields in the reflected light, we
observe that the incoherent field from the cavity exhibits super-bunching with
g2(0)=41+-2 while the coherent field remains Poissonian statistics. By
controlling the relative amplitude of coherent and incoherent fields, we verify
that photon statistics of reflected light is tuneable from perfect
anti-bunching to super-bunching in agreement with our predictions. Our results
demonstrate photon statistics of light as a quantum interference phenomenon
that a single QD can scatter two photons simultaneously at low driving fields
in contrast to the common picture that a single two-level quantum emitter can
only scatter (or absorb and emit) single photons. This work opens the door to
tailoring photon statistics of laser light via cavity or waveguide quantum
electrodynamics and interference.

Bob who wins if he correctly identifies the state. The pretty good measurement,
also known as the square root measurement, performs pretty well at this task.
We study the version of this problem where Bob tries to lose with the greatest
probability possible (which is harder than it sounds). We define the pretty bad
measurement which performs pretty well at this task, or in other words, pretty
poorly for the original task. We show that both the pretty good measurement and
the pretty bad measurement are always no worse than blind guessing at their
respective tasks. As an application, we apply the pretty bad measurement to the
quantum state anomaly detection problem and show how to avoid pretty bad
qubits.

establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV

                                        <span>  Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computation, offering the
potential to solve complex problems intractable for classical computers.
Although current quantum processors already consist of a few hundred of qubits,
their scalability remains a significant challenge. Modular quantum computing
architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale up quantum
computing systems. This paper delves into the critical aspects of distributed
multi-core quantum computing, focusing on quantum circuit mapping, a
fundamental task to successfully execute quantum algorithms across cores while
minimizing inter-core communications. We derive the theoretical bounds on the
number of non-local communications needed for random quantum circuits and
introduce the Hungarian Qubit Assignment (HQA) algorithm, a multi-core mapping
algorithm designed to optimize qubit assignments to cores with the aim of
reducing inter-core communications. Our exhaustive evaluation of HQA against
state-of-the-art circuit mapping algorithms for modular architectures reveals a
$4.9\times$ and $1.6\times$ improvement in terms of execution time and
non-local communications, respectively, compared to the best performing
algorithm. HQA emerges as a very promising scalable approach for mapping
quantum circuits into multi-core architectures, positioning it as a valuable
tool for harnessing the potential of quantum computing at scale.

                                        <span>  The modification of the quantum properties of coherence of photons through
their interaction with matter lies at the heart of the quantum theory of light.
Indeed, the absorption and emission of photons by atoms can lead to different
kinds of light with characteristic quantum statistical properties. As such,
different types of light are typically associated with distinct sources. Here,
we report on the observation of the modification of quantum coherence of
multiphoton systems in free space. This surprising effect is produced by the
scattering of thermal multiphoton wavepackets upon propagation. The
modification of the excitation mode of a photonic system and its associated
quantum fluctuations result in the formation of different light fields with
distinct quantum coherence properties. Remarkably, we show that these processes
of scattering can lead to multiphoton systems with sub-shot-noise quantum
properties. Our observations are validated through the nonclassical formulation
of the emblematic van Cittert-Zernike theorem. We believe that the possibility
of producing quantum systems with modified properties of coherence, through
linear propagation, can have dramatic implications for diverse quantum
technologies.

                                        <span>  In cavity magnomechanical systems, magnetic excitations couple simultaneously
with mechanical vibrations and microwaves, combining the tunability of the
magnetization, the long lifetimes of mechanical modes and the whole measurement
toolbox of microwave systems. Such hybrid systems have been proposed for
applications ranging from thermometry to entanglement generation. However,
backaction noise can hinder the measurement of the mechanical vibrations,
potentially rendering such applications infeasible. In this paper, we
investigate the noise introduced in a mechanical mode of a cavity
magnomechanical system in a one-tone drive scheme and propose a scheme for
realizing backaction evasion measurements of the mechanical vibrations. Our
proposal consists of driving the microwave cavity with two tones separated by
twice the phonon frequency and with amplitudes balanced to generate equal
numbers of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that different configurations of
such a scheme are possible and show that drives centered around the lower
frequency magnon-microwave polariton in a triple resonance scheme add the
minimum imprecision noise in the measurement, even though such configuration is
not the most robust to imperfections.

between quantum and classical computers and has attracted the interest of
experimentalists and theoreticians. In this work we study Boson sampling from
general, single-mode states using a scheme that can generate any such state by
combining Gaussian states and photon number measurements. We derive a formula
that can be used to calculate the output photon number probabilities of these
states after they travel through a linear interferometer. This extends the
Boson sampling protocol to the widest array of possible single-mode states and
from this we show that the complexity scaling of all such states is similar and
hence there is no complexity advantage of using complex input states over
simpler ones.

harmonic oscillator using coherent, e.g., electromagnetic, field and incoherent
control. Coherent control is typically implemented by shaped laser pulse or
tailored electromagnetic field. Incoherent control is implemented by engineered
environment, whose mean number of excitations at the frequency of the
oscillator is used as a control variable. An approach to coherent and
incoherent controls design based on the speed gradient algorithms in general,
finite and differential forms is proposed. It is proved that the differential
form is able to completely manipulate the energy of the oscillator: an
arbitrary energy can be achieved starting from any initial state of the
oscillator. The key instrument which allows for complete energy manipulation in
this case is the use of the engineered environment. A robustified
speed-gradient control algorithm in differential form is also proposed. It is
shown that the proposed robustified control algorithm ensures exponential
stability of the closed loop system which is preserved for sampled-data
control.

information processing and has been utilized to generate entanglement from
independent particles that spatially overlap only at the detection stage. Here
we provide a general controllable scheme capable of generating, from a pure
product state of $N$ qubits, a comprehensive class of multipartite entangled
states, including W, Dicke, GHZ, and cluster states with both bosonic and
fermionic statistics within the framework of spatially localized operations and
classical communication (sLOCC). Using graph-based representations of the sLOCC
framework, we translate the generation schemes of specific entangled states
into colored, complex, and weighted digraphs, each corresponding to a given
experimental setup. This graph-theoretical approach allows for precise
targeting of particular multipartite states, exploration of diverse generation
schemes, and optimization of generation efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that the indistinguishability of identical graph nodes in quantum networks
offers useful perspectives for photonic technology.

interactions is of relevance across a broad set of physical disciplines,
including quantum optics, nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear physics. From
a theoretical viewpoint, these systems are appealing since they can be
efficiently studied with numerics, and in the thermodynamic limit are expected
to be governed by mean-field equations of motion. Over the past years the
capabilities to experimentally create long-range interacting systems have
dramatically improved permitting their control in space and time. This allows
to induce and explore a plethora of nonequilibrium dynamical phases, including
time-crystals and even chaotic regimes. However, establishing the emergence of
these phases from numerical simulations turns out to be surprisingly
challenging. This difficulty led to the assertion that mean-field theory may
not be applicable to time-dependent infinite-range interacting systems. Here,
we rigorously prove that mean-field theory in fact exactly captures their
dynamics, in the thermodynamic limit. We further provide bounds for finite-size
effects and their dependence on the evolution time.

measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times, which incorporate the
incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured
quantum system. In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and
properties of the main quasiprobabilities known in the literature. We also
discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution,
ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like
interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once
defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint
measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities
in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat,
and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given
thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how
absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to
Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange
processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we
explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot
energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium
non-driven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where
quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum
information, sensitivity to local perturbations, quantum work statistics in the
quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions,
for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial,
we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside
straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate
learning.

                                        <span>  In recent years, distributed quantum sensing has gained interest for a range
of applications requiring networks of sensors, from global-scale clock
synchronization to high energy physics. In particular, a network of entangled
sensors can improve not only the sensitivity beyond the shot noise limit, but
also enable a Heisenberg scaling with the number of sensors. Here, using bright
entangled twin beams, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the
detection of a linear combination of two distributed phases beyond the shot
noise limit with a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer. We experimentally
demonstrate a quantum noise reduction of 1.7 dB and a classical 3 dB
signal-to-noise ratio improvement over the separable sensing approach involving
two truncated SU(1,1) interferometers. Additionally, we theoretically extend
the use of a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer to a multi-phase-distributed
sensing scheme that leverages entanglement as a resource to achieve a quantum
improvement in the scaling with the number of sensors in the network. Our
results pave the way for developing quantum enhanced sensor networks that can
achieve an entanglement-enhanced sensitivity.

                                        <span>  The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect provides a paradigmatic example of a
topological phase of matter. FQH edges are theoretically described via models
belonging to the class of chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL) theories [1 (Wen,
2007)]. These theories predict exotic properties of the excitations, such as
fractional charge and fractional statistics. Despite theoretical confidence in
this description and qualitative experimental confirmations, quantitative
experimental evidence for CLL behaviour is scarce. In this work, we study
tunnelling between edge modes in the quantum Hall regime at the filling factor
$\nu=1/3$. We present measurements at different system temperatures and perform
a novel scaling analysis of the experimental data, originally proposed in Ref.
[2 (Schiller et al., 2022)]. Our analysis shows clear evidence of CLL breakdown
- above a certain energy scale. In the low-energy regime, where the scaling
behaviour holds, we extract the property called the scaling dimension and find
it heavily renormalized compared to na\"ive CLL theory predictions. Our results
show that decades-old experiments contain a lot of previously overlooked
information that can be used to investigate the physics of quantum Hall edges.
In particular, we open a road to quantitative experimental studies of (a)
scaling dimension renormalization in quantum point contacts and (b) CLL
breakdown mechanisms at an intermediate energy scale, much smaller than the
bulk gap.

states based on the tensor network formulation of the density matrix. In one
dimension, we introduce strong injective matrix product density operators
(MPDO), which describe a broad class of short-range correlated mixed states,
including the locally decohered SPT states. We map strong injective MPDO to a
pure state in the doubled Hilbert space and define the SPT phases according to
the cohomology class of the symmetry group in the doubled state. Although the
doubled state exhibits an enlarged symmetry, the possible SPT phases are also
constrained by the Hermiticity and the semi-positivity of the density matrix.
We here obtain a complete classification of SPT phases with a direct product of
strong $G$ and weak $K$ unitary symmetry given by the cohomology group
$\mathcal{H}^2(G, \text{U}(1))\oplus\mathcal{H}^1(K, \mathcal{H}^1(G,
\text{U}(1)))$. The SPT phases in our definition are preserved under symmetric
local circuits consisting of non-degenerate channels. This motivates an
alternative definition of SPT phases according to the equivalence class of
mixed states under a ``one-way" connection using symmetric non-degenerate
channels. In locally purifiable MPDO with strong symmetry, we prove that this
alternative definition reproduces the cohomology classification. We further
extend our results to two-dimensional mixed states described by strong
semi-injective tensor network density operators and classify the possible SPT
phases.

non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics by studying relaxation dynamics
described by Davies maps. Starting from a state with coherences in the energy
eigenbasis, we demonstrate that an exponential speedup to equilibrium will
always occur if the state is transformed to a diagonal state in the energy
eigenbasis, provided that the spectral gap of the generator is defined by a
complex eigenvalue. When the transformed state has a higher non-equilibrium
free energy, we argue using thermodynamic reasoning that this is a
\textit{genuine} quantum Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we show how a unitary
transformation on an initial state can always be constructed to yield the
effect and demonstrate our findings by studying the dynamics of both the
non-equilibrium free energy and the irreversible entropy production in single
and multi-qubit examples.

                                        <span>  The spectral form factor (SFF) captures universal spectral fluctuations as
signatures of quantum chaos, and has been instrumental in advancing multiple
frontiers of physics including the studies of black holes and quantum many-body
systems. However, the measurement of SFF in many-body systems is challenging
due to the difficulty in resolving level spacings that become exponentially
small with increasing system size. Here we experimentally measure the SFF to
probe the presence or absence of chaos in quantum many-body systems using a
superconducting quantum processor with a randomized measurement protocol. For a
Floquet chaotic system, we observe signatures of spectral rigidity of random
matrix theory in SFF given by the ramp-plateau behavior. For a Hamiltonian
system, we utilize SFF to distinguish the quantum many-body chaotic phase and
the prethermal many-body localization. We observe the dip-ramp-plateau behavior
of random matrix theory in the chaotic phase, and contrast the scaling of the
plateau time in system size between the many-body chaotic and localized phases.
Furthermore, we probe the eigenstate statistics by measuring a generalization
of the SFF, known as the partial SFF, and observe distinct behaviors in the
purities of the reduced density matrix in the two phases. This work unveils a
new way of extracting the universal signatures of many-body quantum chaos in
quantum devices by probing the correlations in eigenenergies and eigenstates.

optical imaging by combining quantum optics and near-field optics. Our concept
involves the utilization of single-photon quantum emitters to generate a
stand-alone evanescent wave. We demonstrate that the quantum interference
effects of single-photon emitters, in conjunction with their near-field, result
in a higher resolution of subwavelength structures than systems that are only
quantum enhanced or only near-field enhanced. We believe that nano-sized
emitters could be employed to accomplish the goals of this research, taking
into account the current progress in nanophotonics and quantum optics
technology.

                                        <span>  Generalizations of coordinate $x$-momentum $p_x$ Uncertainty Principle, with
$\Delta x$ and $\Delta p_x$ dependent terms ($\Delta$ denoting standard
deviation), $$\Delta x \Delta p_x\geq i\hbar (1+\alpha\Delta p_x^2 +\beta
\Delta x^2)$$ have provided rich dividends as a poor person's approach towards
Quantum Gravity, because these can introduce coordinate and momentum scales
($\alpha,\beta$ ) that are appealing conceptually. However, these extensions of
Uncertainty Principle are purely phenomenological in nature. Apart from the
inherent ambiguity in their explicit structures, the introduction of
generalized commutations relations compatible with the Uncertainty Principle
has serious drawbacks.
  In the present paper we reveal that these generalized Uncertainty Principles
can appear in a perfectly natural way, in canonical quantum mechanics, if one
assumes a periodic nature in coordinate or momentum space, as the case may be.
We bring in to light quite old, (but no so well known), works by Judge and by
Judge and Lewis, that explains in detail how the popularly known structure of
Extended Uncertainty Principle is generated in the case of angle $\phi$ angular
momentum $L_z$, $$\Delta \phi \Delta L_z \geq i\hbar (1 +\nu \Delta \phi^2)$$
purely from a consistent implementation of periodic nature of the angle
variable $\phi $, without changing the $\phi, L_z$ canonical commutation
relation. We directly apply this formalism to construction to formulate
generalizations in $\Delta x \Delta p_x $ Uncertainty Principle. We identify
$\beta$ with an observed length scale relevant in astrophysics context. We
speculate about the $\alpha$ extension.

                                        <span>  Recent progress in developing computational devices based on quantum effects
and demonstrations of solving various tasks using them has actualized the
question of the origin of the quantum advantage. Although various attempts to
quantify and characterize the nature of quantum computational advantage have
been made, this question in the general context remains open: There is no
universal approach that helps to define a scope of problems that quantum
computers are able to speed up, theoretically and in practice. Here we review
an approach to this question based on the concept of complexity and
reachability of quantum states. On the one hand, the class of quantum states
that is of interest for quantum computing should be complex, i.e.
non-simulatable with classical computers with less than exponential resources.
On the other hand, such quantum states should be reachable on a practical
quantum computer. This means that a unitary corresponding to the transformation
of quantum states from initial to desired can be decomposed in a sequence of
single- and two-qubit gates with of no more than polynomial in the number of
qubits. Our consideration paves the way towards understanding the scope of
problems that can be solved by a quantum computer by formulating a sequence of
statements and conjectures on various sets of quantum states.

constant temperature. Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with
degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\beta$, denoted
by $\rho =e^{-\beta H}/ \textrm{tr}(e^{-\beta H})$, is a classical distribution
over product states for all $\beta < 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a
constant. This sudden death of thermal entanglement upends conventional wisdom
about the presence of short-range quantum correlations in Gibbs states.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over
product states. In particular, for any $\beta < 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^3)$, we can
prepare a state $\epsilon$-close to $\rho$ in trace distance with a depth-one
quantum circuit and $\textrm{poly}(n) \log(1/\epsilon)$ classical overhead. A
priori the task of preparing a Gibbs state is a natural candidate for achieving
super-polynomial quantum speedups, but our results rule out this possibility
above a fixed constant temperature.

system consisting of a spin ensemble, an oscillator, and a single probe spin.
In the weak dispersive coupling limit between the spins and the oscillator, a
back-action effect from frequent measurements of the probe spin allows
exponential cooling of the hybrid system. We identify the parameter regimes
necessary to cool the ensemble, the oscillator, or both to their thermal ground
states. Our results contribute to the development of a practical solution for
cooling/polarizing large spin ensembles. More importantly, we show that even
with weak coupling, significant changes in the dynamics of such
ensemble-oscillator hybrid systems can be achieved by manipulating a single
spin. This result provides a relatively simple means of tuning the dynamics of
a hybrid system, which might facilitate advances in many quantum technology
applications such as preparing entangled states in macroscopic objects.

thiol-containing aryl sulfonamide ligand to the tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$
converting enzyme receptor. We show that cQED devices with a modest number of
modes could be employed to simulate multimode systems by re-purposing working
modes through measurement and re-initialization. We anticipate a wide range of
GBS applications could be implemented on compact 3D cQED processors
analogously, using the holographic approach. Simulations on qubit-based quantum
computers could be implemented analogously, using circuits that represent
continuous variables in terms of truncated expansions of Fock states.

                                        <span>  The rapid development of quantum science and technology is leading us into an
era where quantum many-body systems can be comprehended through quantum
simulations. Holographic duality, which states gravity and spacetime can emerge
from strongly interacting systems, then offers a natural avenue for the
experimental study of gravity physics without delving into experimentally
infeasible high energies. A prominent example is the simulation of traversable
wormholes through the wormhole teleportation protocol, attracting both
theoretical and experimental attention. In this work, we develop the
theoretical framework for computing the fidelity of wormhole teleportation in
$N$-qubit systems with all-to-all interactions, quantified by mutual
information and entanglement negativity. The main technique is the scramblon
effective theory, which captures universal out-of-time-order correlations in
generic chaotic systems. We clarify that strong couplings between the two
systems are essential for simulating the probe limit of semi-classical
traversable wormholes using strongly interacting systems with near-maximal
chaos. However, the teleportation signal diminishes rapidly when reducing the
system size $N$, requiring a large number of qubits to observe a sharp
signature of emergent geometry by simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This
includes both the causal time-order of signals and the asymmetry of the
teleportation signal for coupling with different signs. As a comparison, the
teleportation signal increases when reducing $N$ in weakly interacting systems.
We also analyze the fidelity of the generalized encoding scheme in fermionic
string operators.

present variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that encode both space and time
in qubit registers. The spacetime encoding enables us to obtain the entire time
evolution from a single ground-state computation. We describe a general
procedure to construct efficient quantum circuits for the cost function
evaluation required by VQAs. To mitigate the barren plateau problem during the
optimization, we propose an adaptive multigrid strategy. The approach is
illustrated for the nonlinear Burgers equation. We classically optimize quantum
circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q
System One and Quantinuum System Model H1, and demonstrate that current quantum
computers are capable of accurately reproducing the exact results.

designed fluxonium circuit in a zero magnetic field. The qubit has a frequency
of about 4 GHz and the energy relaxation quality factor $Q \approx 0.7\times
10^7$, even though the dielectric loss quality factor of the circuit components
is in the low $10^5$ range. The Ramsey coherence time exceeds 100 us, and the
average fidelity of Clifford gates is benchmarked to $\mathcal{F} > 0.999$.
These figures are likely to improve by an order of magnitude with optimized

``partially protected" superconducting qubit with an error rate comparable to
the best transmons.

have recently emerged as building blocks for hybrid quantum circuits. In this
study, we present a gatemon fabricated in planar Germanium. We induce
superconductivity in a two-dimensional hole gas by evaporating aluminum atop a
thin spacer, which separates the superconductor from the Ge quantum well. The
Josephson junction is then integrated into an Xmon circuit and capacitively
coupled to a transmission line resonator. We showcase the qubit tunability in a
broad frequency range with resonator and two-tone spectroscopy. Time-domain
characterizations reveal energy relaxation and coherence times up to 75 ns. Our
results, combined with the recent advances in the spin qubit field, pave the
way towards novel hybrid and protected qubits in a group IV, CMOS-compatible
material.

including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized
via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling
becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a
transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies
indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum
extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of
normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected
analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained
analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes
of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these
results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic
elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale
numerical checks.

noise and low qubit counts. Despite this, effective quantum advantage can still
be achieved due to the exponential nature of bit-to-qubit conversion. However,
optimizing the software architecture of these systems is essential to utilize
available resources efficiently. Unfortunately, the focus on user-friendly
quantum computers has obscured critical steps in the software stack, leading to
ripple effects into the stack's upper layer induced by limitations in current

                                        <span>  Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is
fundamentally impeded by the high dynamic range between the star and the
planet. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet
signatures by optically rejecting light from the host star while leaving light
from the exoplanet mostly unaltered. However it is unclear whether coronagraphs
constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant
exoplanet discovery. In this work, we report the quantum information limits of
exoplanet detection and localization specified by the Quantum Chernoff Exponent
(QCE) and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) respectively. In view of
these quantum limits, we assess and compare several high-performance
coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve total rejection of an on-axis
point source. We find that systems which exclusively eliminate the fundamental
mode of the telescope without attenuating higher-order orthogonal modes are
quantum-optimal in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Importantly, the
QFIM is shown to persist well below the diffraction-limit of the telescope,
suggesting that quantum-optimal coronagraphs may further expand the domain of
accessible exoplanets.

within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent
era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to
focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to
observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last
mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each
mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the
additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement
entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume
term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late
times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the
magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the
quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation.
Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting
fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during
inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an
observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would
interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after
inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.

                                        <span>  Polaritons are promising for important applications including organic solar
cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. In low-Q microcavities, polaritonic
signatures of strongly hybridized photons and Frenkel excitons were previously
found to decay together with dark excitons. There remain unresolved questions
regarding whether dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling.
Additionally, the contributions of dark excitons in organic layers and hot
electrons in metal films to the polaritonic response are not fully understood.
Here, we identified that due to delocalization of polaritons over organic and
metal layers, they are sensitive to both dark excitons and hot electrons. Dark
excitons modulate exciton-photon coupling strength, whereas hot-electrons
imprint two-temperature dynamics onto the polaritonic response. Both organic
and metal films contribute to transient Fano-like gain-loss spectra of
exciton-polaritons. These and other mechanistic insights into the
strong-coupling dynamics were supported by the theory of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian mechanics, axially-resolved optical simulations, global analysis of
pump-probe spectra, and statistical correlation analysis. The developed
methodology can be applied to other microcavity structures. Our findings are
important for disentangling pure polaritonic effects from other excitations in
organic and metal layers, with the ultimate aim of achieving photonic control
over photophysical and photochemical processes.

                                        <span>  Information-theoretic insights have proven fruitful in many areas of quantum
physics. But can the fundamental dynamics of quantum systems be derived from
purely information-theoretic principles, without resorting to Hilbert space
structures such as unitary evolution and self-adjoint observables? Here we
provide a model where the dynamics originates from a condition of informational
non-equilibrium, the deviation of the system's state from a reference state
associated to a field of identically prepared systems. Combining this idea with
three basic information-theoretic principles, we derive a notion of energy that
captures the main features of energy in quantum theory: it is observable,
bounded from below, invariant under time-evolution, in one-to-one
correspondence with the generator of the dynamics, and quantitatively related
to the speed of state changes. Our results provide an information-theoretic
reconstruction of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum evolutions,
establishing a bridge between dynamical and information-theoretic notions.

construct a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine. By deriving the conditions
under which the thermodynamic cycle is closed we study the effects of motion on
the amount of work that can be extracted from the machine when the working
medium is moving at a constant relativistic velocity through the heat baths.
While there is a degrading effect with respect to speed in the hot bath, we
demonstrate that in the case of the cold bath, genuine enhancing effects are
sometimes present. For couplings the same order as the inverse frequency of the
detector and a specific value for the temporal separation between the two
instantaneous interactions--needed in order to be possible to cool the
detector--a non-monotonic dependence between speed and extracted work exists
raising the intriguing possibility of exploiting relativistic effects for the

                                        <span>  Quantum state reconstruction is an essential element in quantum information
processing. However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of non-trivial
quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging.
This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in
continuous-variable (CV) systems, as many error-prone measurements are needed
to cover the relevant degrees of freedom of the system in phase space. In this
work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique for optimized
reconstruction based on excitation number sampling (ORENS). We use a standard
bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally
demonstrate the robustness of ORENS and show that it outperforms the existing
cQED reconstruction techniques such as Wigner and Husimi Q tomography. Our
investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system
dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware. Finally, ORENS
relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of the
state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV
platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems. Thus, our work provides a
crucial and valuable primitive for practical quantum information processing
using bosonic modes.

                                        <span>  The qubit scalability imposes a paramount challenge in the field of quantum
computing. Photonic interconnects between distinct quantum computing modules
provide a solution to deal with this issue. The fundamental part of this
approach is entanglement distribution via travelling photons emitted by matter
qubits. However, randomness of the spontaneous emission in the matter qubits
limits both the entanglement fidelity and the generation rate. In this paper,
by numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the relationship between
the entanglement affected by the spontaneous emission and the waveform of the
pump pulse used in the photon generation. We confirm and analyze a
rate-fidelity trade-off in the entanglement swapping with Gaussian pump pulses
and show that a simple extension to non-Gaussian pump pulses improves the
trade-off in a certain parameter region. Furthermore we extend our analysis to
entanglement distribution in the general multipartite setting and show that the
analysis of the bipartite entanglement can be straightforwardly applied in this
case as well.

                                        <span>  The existence of zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transitions
seems inconsistent with conventional statistical physics. This work clarifies
this apparent inconsistency. We demonstrate the corresponding effective field
theories and finite-temperature properties of light-matter interacting systems,
and show how this zero-dimensional quantum phase transition occurs. We first
focus on the Rabi model, which is a minimum model that hosts a superradiant
quantum phase transition. With the path integral method, we derive the
imaginary-time action of the photon degrees of freedom. We also define a
dynamical critical exponent as the rescaling between the temperature and the
photon frequency, and perform dimensional analysis to the effective action. The
dynamical critical exponent shows that the effective theory of the Rabi model
is a free scalar field, where a true second-order quantum phase transition
emerges. These results are also verified by numerical simulations of
imaginary-time correlation functions of the order parameter. Furthermore, we
also generalize this method to the Dicke model. Our results make the
zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transition compatible with
conventional statistical physics, and pave the way to understand it in the
perspective of effective field theories.

                                        <span>  Quantum systems are unavoidably open to their surrounding degrees of freedom.
The theory of open quantum systems is thus crucial to understanding the
fluctuations, dissipation, and decoherence of a quantum system of interest.
Typically, the bath is modeled as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators, which
yields Gaussian statistics of the bath influence on the quantum systems.
However, there are also phenomena in which the bath consists of two-state
systems, spins, or anharmonic oscillators; therefore, the non-Gaussian
properties of the bath become important. Nevertheless, a theoretical framework
to describe quantum systems under the influence of such non-Gaussian baths is
not well established. Here, we develop a theory to describe quantum dissipative
systems affected by Poisson noise properties of the bath, because the
L\'evi-It\^o decomposition theorem asserts that Poisson noise is fundamental in
describing arbitrary white noise beyond Gaussian properties. We introduce a
quantum bath model that allows for the consistent description of dissipative
quantum systems. The obtained master equation reveals non-Gaussian bath effects
in the white noise regime, and provides an essential step toward describing
open quantum dynamics under the influence of generic baths.

                                        <span>  We develop three new methods to implement any Linear Combination of Unitaries
(LCU), a powerful quantum algorithmic tool with diverse applications. While the
standard LCU procedure requires several ancilla qubits and sophisticated
multi-qubit controlled operations, our methods consume significantly fewer
quantum resources. The first method (Single-Ancilla LCU) estimates expectation
values of observables with respect to any quantum state prepared by an LCU
procedure while requiring only a single ancilla qubit, and no multi-qubit
controlled operations. The second approach (Analog LCU) is a simple, physically
motivated, continuous-time analogue of LCU, tailored to hybrid qubit-qumode
systems. The third method (Ancilla-free LCU) requires no ancilla qubit at all
and is useful when we are interested in the projection of a quantum state
(prepared by the LCU procedure) in some subspace of interest. We apply the
first two techniques to develop new quantum algorithms for a wide range of
practical problems, ranging from Hamiltonian simulation, ground state
preparation and property estimation, and quantum linear systems. Remarkably,
despite consuming fewer quantum resources they retain a provable quantum
advantage. The third technique allows us to connect discrete and
continuous-time quantum walks with their classical counterparts. It also
unifies the recently developed optimal quantum spatial search algorithms in
both these frameworks, and leads to the development of new ones that require
fewer ancilla qubits. Overall, our results are quite generic and can be readily
applied to other problems, even beyond those considered here.

fault tolerance, the validity of simplified error models underpinning the study
of quantum error correction needs to be experimentally evaluated. In this work,
we have assessed the performance of IBM superconducting quantum computer
devices implementing heavy-hexagon code syndrome measurements with increasing
circuit sizes up to 23 qubits, against the error assumptions underpinning code
threshold calculations. Circuit operator change rate statistics in the presence
of depolarizing and biased noise were modelled using analytic functions of
error model parameters. Data from 16 repeated syndrome measurement cycles was
found to be inconsistent with a uniform depolarizing noise model, favouring
instead biased and inhomogeneous noise models. Spatial-temporal correlations
investigated via $Z$ stabilizer measurements revealed significant temporal
correlation in detection events. These results highlight the non-trivial
structure which may be present in the noise of quantum error correction
circuits, revealed by operator measurement statistics, and support the
development of noise-tailored codes and decoders to adapt.

nonreciprocal hopping, where the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is found to
be dissolved gradually as the strength of nonreciprocity increases. The energy
spectrum under the open boundary condition is composed of real and imaginary
eigenenergies when the nonreciprocal hopping is weak. Interestingly, the real
eigenenergies form an equally spaced ladder, and the corresponding eigenstates
are localized at the boundary with a Gaussian distribution due to NHSE. By
increasing the nonreciprocity, the number of real eigenenergies will decrease
while more and more eigenenergies become imaginary. Accompanied by the
real-imaginary transition in the spectrum, the eigenstates are shifted from the
boundary into the bulk of the lattice. When the nonreciprocity gets strong
enough, the whole spectrum will be imaginary and the NHSE disappears completely
in the system; i.e., all the eigenstates become Gaussian bound states localized
inside the bulk. Our work unveils the exotic properties of non-Hermitian
systems with spatially varying nonreciprocal hopping.

                                        <span>  Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a common architecture resource for
algorithms with many proposed applications, including quantum chemistry,
windowed quantum arithmetic, unstructured search, machine learning, and quantum
cryptography. Here we propose two bucket-brigade QRAM architectures based on
high-coherence superconducting resonators, which differ in their realizations
of the conditional-routing operations. In the first, we directly construct
controlled-$\mathsf{SWAP}$ ($\textsf{CSWAP}$) operations, while in the second
we utilize the properties of giant-unidirectional emitters (GUEs). For both
architectures we analyze single-rail and dual-rail implementations of a bosonic
qubit. In the single-rail encoding we can detect first-order ancilla errors,
while the dual-rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon
losses. For parameter regimes of interest the post-selected infidelity of a
QRAM query in a dual-rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below
that of a corresponding query in a single-rail architecture. These findings
suggest that dual-rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures
for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance.

                                        <span>  Explaining the behavior of macroscopic objects from the point of view of the
quantum paradigm has challenged the scientific community for a century today. A
mechanism of gravitational self-interaction, governed by the so-called
Schroedinger-Newton equation, is among the proposals that aim to shed some
light on it. Despite all efforts, this mechanism has been proven difficult to
probe. Here, we consider a simple Stern-Gerlach-like experiment to try it out.
The Schroedinger-Newton equation can be analytically solved under certain
proper conditions, and a dephasing effect induced by the gravitational
self-interacting potential can be calculated.

                                        <span>  Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have
an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom
on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one
approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of
freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called
``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in
earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same
universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate
the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient
for quantum simulations.

                                        <span>  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold much promise but face the
challenge of exponentially small gradients. Unmitigated, this barren plateau
(BP) phenomenon leads to an exponential training overhead for VQAs. Perhaps the
most pernicious are noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs), a type of
unavoidable BP arising from open system effects, which have so far been shown
to exist for unital noise maps. Here, we generalize the study of NIBPs to more
general completely positive, trace-preserving maps, establishing the existence
of NIBPs in the unital case and a class of non-unital maps we call
Hilbert-Schmidt (HS)-contractive. The latter includes amplitude damping. We
tighten to logarithmic earlier bounds on the circuit depth at which an NIBP
appears. We identify the associated phenomenon of noise-induced fixed points
(NIFP) of the VQA cost function and prove its existence for both unital and
HS-contractive non-unital noise maps. Along the way, we extend the parameter
shift rule of VQAs to the noisy setting. We provide rigorous bounds in terms of
the relevant parameters that give rise to NIBPs and NIFPs, along with numerical
simulations of the depolarizing and amplitude-damping maps that illustrate our
analytical results.

over $m=\mathcal{O}(n^k)$ binary variables using only $n$ qubits, with tunable
$k>1$. The number of parameters and circuit depth display mild linear and
sublinear scalings in $m$, respectively. Moreover, we analytically prove that
the specific qubit-efficient encoding brings in a super-polynomial mitigation
of barren plateaus as a built-in feature. This leads to unprecedented
quantum-solver performances. For $m=7000$, numerical simulations produce
solutions competitive in quality with state-of-the-art classical solvers. In
turn, for $m=2000$, an experiment with $n=17$ trapped-ion qubits featured
MaxCut approximation ratios estimated to be beyond the hardness threshold
$0.941$. To our knowledge, this is the highest quality attained experimentally
on such sizes. Our findings offer a novel heuristics for quantum-inspired
solvers as well as a promising route towards solving commercially-relevant
problems on near term quantum devices.

quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set
of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well
studied in the literature, namely the unextendible product basis by Bennett et
al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces
explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4
(2004)]. More recently Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)];
Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [arXiv:
2309.05144, (2023)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure
product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing
different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendible product
basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear
spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and
theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain
unextendible product bases, their orthogonal complements, and also
Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces. Finally we give examples of
perturbations with infinitely many pure product states.

flipper in between. The Frisch and Segr\`e experiment has been modeled
analytically by Majorana without the nuclear effect and subsequently revised by
Rabi with the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do
not match the experimental observation accurately. Here, we numerically solve
the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, including
the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. Thus far, the
coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model
without using free parameters are still low, indicating a mismatch between the
theory and the experiment. Non-standard variants that improve the match are
explored for discussion.

                                        <span>  A key to understanding unconventional superconductivity lies in unraveling
the pairing mechanism of mobile charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets,
yielding an effective attraction between charges even in the presence of strong
repulsive Coulomb interactions. Here, we study pairing in a mixed-dimensional
(mixD) $t-J$ model, featuring robust binding energies -- despite dominant
repulsive interactions -- that are strongly enhanced in the finite doping
regime. The single and coupled mixD ladders we study, corresponding to bilayers
of width $w\leq 2$, feature a crossover from tightly bound pairs of holes
(closed channel) at small repulsion, to more spatially extended, correlated
pairs of individual holes (open channel) at large repulsion. We derive an
effective model for the latter, in which the attraction is mediated by the
closed channel, in analogy to atomic Feshbach resonances. Using density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) simulations we reveal a dome of large binding
energies at around $30\%$ doping, accompanied by a change of the Fermi surface
volume and a crossover from extended to tightly bound hole pairs. Our work
provides a microscopic theory of pairing in the doped mixD system with dominant
repulsion, closely related to bilayer, Ni-based superconductors, and our
predictions can be tested in state-of-the-art quantum simulators.

                                        <span>  We develop and demonstrate a trainable temporal post-processor (TPP)
harnessing a simple but versatile machine learning algorithm to provide optimal
processing of quantum measurement data subject to arbitrary noise processes,
for the readout of an arbitrary number of quantum states. We demonstrate the
TPP on the essential task of qubit state readout, which has historically relied
on temporal processing via matched filters in spite of their applicability only
for specific noise conditions. Our results show that the TPP can reliably
outperform standard filtering approaches under complex readout conditions, such
as high power readout. Using simulations of quantum measurement noise sources,
we show that this advantage relies on the TPP's ability to learn optimal linear
filters that account for general quantum noise correlations in data, such as
those due to quantum jumps, or correlated noise added by a phase-preserving
quantum amplifier. We show that the transformation described by the TPP can be
expressed via an efficient semi-analytic form, providing a linearly-scaling
generalization of matched filtering to an arbitrary number of states under the
most general noise conditions of the readout signal emanating from the
measurement chain. The TPP can be efficiently, autonomously, and reliably
trained on measurement data, and requires only linear operations, making it
ideal for FPGA implementations in cQED for real-time processing of measurement
data from general quantum systems.

optical frequency comb interferometry. However, comb-based measurements are not
described by existing quantum theory because they exhibit both large mode
mismatch and finite strength local oscillators. To establish this quantum
theory, we derive measurement operators for homodyne detection with arbitrary
mode overlap. These operators are a combination of quadrature and
intensity-like measurements, which inform a filter that maximizes the
quadrature measurement signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, these operators
establish a foundation to extend frequency-comb interferometry to a wide range
of scenarios, including metrology with nonclassical states of light.

limited memory capabilities since it only uses an initial non-adaptive

                                        <span>  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two users to set
up shared cryptographic key without the need to trust the quantum devices used.
Doing so requires nonlocal correlations between the users. However, in [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 127, 050503 (2021)] it was shown that for known protocols
nonlocality is not always sufficient, leading to the question of whether there
is a fundamental lower bound on the minimum amount of nonlocality needed for
any DIQKD implementation. Here we show that no such bound exists, giving
schemes that achieve key with correlations arbitrarily close to the local set.
Furthermore, some of our constructions achieve the maximum of 1 bit of key per
pair of entangled qubits. We achieve this by studying a family of
Bell-inequalities that constitute all self-tests of the maximally entangled
state with a single linear Bell expression. Within this family there exist
non-local correlations with the property that one pair of inputs yield outputs
arbitrarily close to perfect key. Such correlations exist for a range of
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) values, including those arbitrarily close to
the classical bound. Finally, we show the existence of quantum correlations
that can generate both perfect key and perfect randomness simultaneously,
whilst also displaying arbitrarily small CHSH violation; this opens up the
possibility of a new class of cryptographic protocol.

                                        <span>  Multivariate functions of continuous variables arise in countless branches of
science. Numerical computations with such functions typically involve a
compromise between two contrary desiderata: accurate resolution of the
functional dependence, versus parsimonious memory usage. Recently, two
promising strategies have emerged for satisfying both requirements: (i) The
quantics representation, which expresses functions as multi-index tensors, with
each index representing one bit of a binary encoding of one of the variables;
and (ii) tensor cross interpolation (TCI), which, if applicable, yields
parsimonious interpolations for multi-index tensors. Here, we present a
strategy, quantics TCI (QTCI), which combines the advantages of both schemes.
We illustrate its potential with an application from condensed matter physics:
the computation of Brillouin zone integrals.

                                        <span>  Ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors are highly precise
sensors for weak forces, limited in sensitivity across their detection band by
quantum fluctuations of light. Current and future instruments address this
limitation by injecting frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum into the detection
port, utilizing narrow-band, low-loss optical cavities for optimal rotation of
the squeezing ellipse at each signal frequency. This study introduces a novel
scheme employing the principles of quantum teleportation and entangled states
of light. It allows achieving broadband suppression of quantum noise in detuned
signal recycled-Fabry-Perot--Michelson interferometers, which is the baseline
design of the low-frequency detector within the Einstein Telescope xylophone
detector, without requiring additional filter cavities or modifications to the
core optics of the main interferometer.

                                        <span>  Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic
degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation
using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more
scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for
such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the
quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the
Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one
spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of
measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm
to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we
present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states
using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework.
We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian
based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the
corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with
system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the
gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods
for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied
to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost
resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant
implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical
instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to
improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this
might be achieved.

                                        <span>  Nanodevices exploiting quantum effects are critically important elements of
future quantum technologies (QT), but their real-world performance is strongly
limited by decoherence arising from local `environmental' interactions.
Compounding this, as devices become more complex, i.e. contain multiple
functional units, the `local' environments begin to overlap, creating the
possibility of environmentally mediated decoherence phenomena on new
time-and-length scales. Such complex and inherently non-Markovian dynamics
could present a challenge for scaling up QT, but -- on the other hand -- the
ability of environments to transfer `signals' and energy might also enable
sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination of inter-component processes, as is
suggested to happen in biological nanomachines, like enzymes and photosynthetic
proteins. Exploiting numerically exact many body methods (tensor networks) we
study a fully quantum model that allows us to explore how propagating
environmental dynamics can instigate and direct the evolution of spatially
remote, non-interacting quantum systems. We demonstrate how energy dissipated
into the environment can be remotely harvested to create transient
excited/reactive states, and also identify how reorganisation triggered by
system excitation can qualitatively and reversibly alter the `downstream'
kinetics of a `functional' quantum system. With access to complete
system-environment wave functions, we elucidate the microscopic processes
underlying these phenomena, providing new insight into how they could be
exploited for energy efficient quantum devices.

subject to repetitive ancilla-based measurements. This setup is a fundamental
minimal model for exploring the intricate interplay between the unitary
dynamics of the system and the nonunitary stochasticity introduced by quantum
measurements, which is central to the phenomenon of measurement-induced phase
transitions. We demonstrate that this "toy model" harbors remarkably rich
dynamics, manifesting in the distribution function of the qubit's quantum
states in the long-time limit. We uncover a compelling analogy with the
phenomenon of Anderson localization, albeit governed by distinct underlying
mechanisms. Specifically, the state distribution function of the monitored
qubit, parameterized by a single angle on the Bloch sphere, exhibits diverse
types of behavior familiar from the theory of Anderson transitions, spanning
from complete localization to almost uniform delocalization, with fractality
occurring between the two limits. By combining analytical solutions for various
special cases with two complementary numerical approaches, we achieve a
comprehensive understanding of the structure delineating the "phase diagram" of
the model. We categorize and quantify the emergent regimes and identify two
distinct phases of the monitored qubit: ergodic and nonergodic. Furthermore, we
identify a genuinely localized phase within the nonergodic phase, where the
state distribution functions consist of delta peaks, as opposed to the
delocalized phase characterized by extended distributions. Identification of
these phases and demonstration of transitions between them in a monitored qubit
are our main findings.

information over an entanglement unassisted two-sender quantum multiple access
channel (QMAC) and an unassisted two-sender two-receiver quantum interference
channel (QIC). Previous works only studied the unassisted QMAC in the limit of
many independent and identical uses of the channel also known as the asymptotic
iid limit, and did not study the unassisted QIC at all. We employ two
techniques, rate splitting and successive cancellation}, in order to obtain our
inner bound. Rate splitting was earlier used to obtain inner bounds, avoiding
time sharing, for classical channels in the asymptotic iid setting. Our main
technical contribution is to extend rate splitting from the classical
asymptotic iid setting to the quantum one-shot setting. In the asymptotic iid
limit our one-shot inner bound for QMAC approaches the rate region of Yard,
Devetak and Hayden. For the QIC we get novel non-trivial rate regions in the
asymptotic iid setting. All our results also extend to the case where limited
entanglement assistance is provided, in both one-shot and asymptotic iid
settings. The limited entanglement results for one-setting for both QMAC and
QIC are new. For the QIC the limited entanglement results are new even in the
asymptotic iid setting.

branches of quantum information and related technological applications, we
analyze and compare two strategies currently used to obtain (approximately)
steady states in strong coupling. The first strategy is based on perturbative
expansions while the second one uses reaction coordinate mapping. Focusing on
the widely used spin-boson model, we show that, as expected and hoped, the
predictions of these two strategies coincide for some parameter regions. This
confirms and strengthens the relevance of both techniques. Beyond that, it is
also crucial to know precisely their respective range of validity. In that
perspective, thanks to their different limitations, we use one to benchmark the
other. We introduce and successfully test some very simple validity criteria
for both strategies, bringing some answers to the question of the validity
range.

$(-s,s)$, associated with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Let
$\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ denote the trace class integral operator
acting on $L^2(-s, s)$ with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Our focus is
on deriving the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $\det(I-\gamma
\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s)$ as $s \to +\infty$, while simultaneously
$\gamma \to 1^-$ in a super-exponential region. In this regime of double
scaling limit, our asymptotic result also gives us asymptotics of the
eigenvalues $\lambda^{(\alpha, \beta)}_k(s)$ of the integral operator
$\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ as $s \to +\infty$. Based on the integrable
structure of the confluent hypergeometric kernel, we derive our asymptotic
results by applying the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to analyze
the related Riemann-Hilbert problem.

                                        <span>  Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary
for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion
charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field
flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only
in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity
equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of
on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends
itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d
super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric
super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.

                                        <span>  We develop a constructive approach to generate quantum neural networks
capable of representing the exact thermal states of all many-body qubit
Hamiltonians. The Trotter expansion of the imaginary-time propagator is
implemented through an exact block encoding by means of a unitary, restricted
Boltzmann machine architecture. Marginalization over the hidden-layer neurons
(auxiliary qubits) creates the non-unitary action on the visible layer. Then,
we introduce a unitary deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which the
hidden-layer qubits are allowed to couple laterally to other hidden qubits. We
prove that this wave function ansatz is closed under the action of the
imaginary-time propagator and, more generally, can represent the action of a
universal set of quantum gate operations. We provide analytic expressions for
the coefficients for both architectures, thus enabling exact network
representations of thermal states without stochastic optimization of the
network parameters. In the limit of large imaginary time, the ansatz yields the
ground state of the system. The number of qubits grows linearly with the system
size and total imaginary time for a fixed interaction order. Both networks can
be readily implemented on quantum hardware via mid-circuit measurements of
auxiliary qubits. If only one auxiliary qubit is measured and reset, the
circuit depth scales linearly with imaginary time and system size, while the
width is constant. Alternatively, one can employ a number of auxiliary qubits
linearly proportional to the system size, and circuit depth grows linearly with
imaginary time only.

representation of the braid group and Temperley-Lieb algebra. The pseudounitary
representation that we consider allows constructing ``states'' from the
group/algebra matrices and compute the knot invariants as matrix elements,
rather than traces. In comparison with a more standard way of computing the
invariants through traces, the matrix element method is more interesting and
complete from the point of view of applications. As a byproduct of the
discussion we prove a general formula for pretzel knots.

                                        <span>  Fluctuations exist in any material object $A$. If $A$ has non-zero
temperature $T$, one speaks about thermal fluctuations. If $A$ is at very low
$T$, the fluctuations are of quantum origin. Interesting effects appear if two
bodies $A$ and $B$ are separated by a fluctuating medium $C$ (say a vacuum, or
a fluid close to its {\it critical point}) when the fluctuations are
long-ranged, i.e., they decay according to a power-law with the distance. Then
the changes of fluctuations in $C$ due to the surfaces and constituents of $A$
are also felt by $B$, and \textit{vice versa}, which leads to a fluctuation
induced force (FIF) between them. This force persists in addition to the direct
influence of $A$ on $B$ (say, via gravity or Coulomb's force). These FIF's can
be of attractive or repulsive character. They may play crucially important role
on phenomena involving objects with length scale comparative with the Universe,
as well as to the tiny objects relevant for MEMS and NEMS. In the current
article we present some basic facts for the FIF and their diversity. Then on
the example of one dimensional Ising model with a defect bond we present some
new analytical results for such forces.

operators to Dirac operators with zigzag type boundary conditions. We prove
that the convergence holds in strong but not in norm resolvent sense. Moreover,
we show that the only obstruction for having norm resolvent convergence is the
existence of an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity for the limiting operator.
More precisely, we prove the convergence of the resolvents in operator norm
once projected into the orthogonal of the corresponding eigenspace.

the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits
an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore
be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by
topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has
a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to
intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in two different ways,
Hurwitz numbers and quantum curves. The same method is used to establish
analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the
recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.

                                        <span>  We build a transient multidimensional multiphysical model based on continuum
theories, involving the coupled mechanical, thermal and electrochemical
phenomena occurring simultaneously in the discharge or charge of lithium-ion
batteries. The process delivers a system of coupled nonlinear partial
differential equations. Besides initial and boundary conditions, we highlight
the treatment of the electrode-electrolyte interface condition, which
corresponds to a Butler-Volmer reaction kinetics equation. We present the
derivation of the strong and weak forms of the model, as well as the
discretization procedure in space and in time. The discretized model is
computationally solved in two dimensions by means of a finite element method
that employs $hp$ layered meshes, along with staggered second order
semi-implicit time integration. The expected error estimate is of higher order
than any other similar work, both in space and in time. A representative
battery cell geometry, under distinct operating scenarios, is simulated. The
numerical results show that the full model allows for important additional
insights to be drawn than when caring only for the electrochemical coupling.
Considering the multiphysics becomes more important as the applied current is
increased, whether for discharge or for charge. Our full model provides battery
design professionals with a valuable tool to optimize designs and advance the
energy storage industry.

                                        <span>  In this article we continue the study of the collapse of three inelastic
particles in dimension $d \geq 2$, complementing the results we obtained in its
companion paper. We focus on the particular case of the nearly-linear inelastic
collapse, when the order of collisions becomes eventually the infinite
repetition of the period $0-1$, $0-2$, under the assumption that the relative
velocities of the particles (with respect to the central particle $0$) do not
vanish at the time of collapse. Taking as starting point the full dynamical
system that describes two consecutive collisions of the nearly-linear collapse,
we derive formally a two-dimensional dynamical system, called the two-collision
mapping. This mapping governs the evolution of the variables of the full
dynamical system. We show in particular that in the so-called Zhou-Kadanoff
regime, the orbits of the two-collision mapping can be described in full
detail. We study rigorously the two-collision mapping, proving that the
Zhou-Kadanoff regime is stable and locally attracting in a certain region of
the phase space of the two-collision mapping. We describe all the fixed points
of the two-collision mapping in the case when the norms of the relative
velocities tend to the same positive limit. We establish conjectures to
characterize the orbits that verify the Zhou-Kadanoff regime, motivated by
numerical simulations, and we prove these conjectures for a simplified version
of the two-collision mapping.

in two dimensions. The proof is based on a new covariant approach, which
consists of two parts: First, we introduce covariant stochastic objects. The
covariant stochastic objects and their multi-linear interactions are controlled
using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders
using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of
Hamilton.

                                        <span>  We show that thermal states of local Hamiltonians are separable above a
constant temperature. Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with
degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\beta$, denoted
by $\rho =e^{-\beta H}/ \textrm{tr}(e^{-\beta H})$, is a classical distribution
over product states for all $\beta < 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a
constant. This sudden death of thermal entanglement upends conventional wisdom
about the presence of short-range quantum correlations in Gibbs states.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over
product states. In particular, for any $\beta < 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^3)$, we can
prepare a state $\epsilon$-close to $\rho$ in trace distance with a depth-one
quantum circuit and $\textrm{poly}(n) \log(1/\epsilon)$ classical overhead. A
priori the task of preparing a Gibbs state is a natural candidate for achieving
super-polynomial quantum speedups, but our results rule out this possibility
above a fixed constant temperature.

quad equations of the ABS list. Two of our new Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad
equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their
Euler-Lagrange equations, whereas the third produces the tetrahedron equations.
This is in contrast to the well-established Lagrangian 2-form for these
equations, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations
(they are equivalent to two octahedron equations). We use relations between the
Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to
the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for
each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, existing and new, we study the double zero
property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible
variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.

theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global
symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as
well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold
gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral
methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge
theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields
for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive
reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those
orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and
relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We
extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries
of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized
$\theta$-angle.

a class of Lie algebras encoding the symmetries of spacetime. Homogeneous
spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated to these possible
kinematics can be partitioned into four families -- riemannian, lorentzian,
galilean and carrollian -- based on the type of invariant metric structure they
admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics -- defined as
extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal -- as well as their
associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along
the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient
Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique -- trivial and
torsion-free -- higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are
constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein
pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its
curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically
allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation
between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian
Klein pairs.

                                        <span>  The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of
the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by
compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019,
surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular
forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive
array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural
questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the
different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular
forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group
$SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular
forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form
structure by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with
supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued
quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat
Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it
was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat
Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold,
suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by
providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite
family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third,
we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type
invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator
algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of
logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.

                                        <span>  We construct combinatorial analogs of 2d higher topological quantum field
theories. We consider triangulations as vertices of a certain CW complex $\Xi$.
In the "flip theory," cells of $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ correspond to polygonal
decompositions obtained by erasing the edges in a triangulation. These theories
assign to a cobordism $\Sigma$ a cochain $Z$ on $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ constructed
as a contraction of structure tensors of a cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra $V$
assigned to polygons. The cyclic $A_\infty$ equations imply the closedness
equation $(\delta+Q)Z=0$. In this context we define combinatorial BV operators
and give examples with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the "secondary
polytope theory," $\Xi_\mathrm{sp}$ is the secondary polytope (due to
Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky) and the cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra has to be
replaced by an appropriate refinement that we call an $\widehat{A}_\infty$
algebra. We conjecture the existence of a good Pachner CW complex $\Xi$ for any
cobordism, whose local combinatorics is descibed by secondary polytopes and the
homotopy type is that of Zwiebach's moduli space of complex structures.
Depending on this conjecture, one has an "ideal model" of combinatorial 2d
HTQFT determined by a local $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra.

                                        <span>  Analytical methods are fundamental in studying acoustics problems. One of the
important tools is the Wiener-Hopf method, which can be used to solve many
canonical problems with sharp transitions in boundary conditions on a
plane/plate. However, there are some strict limitations to its use, usually the
boundary conditions need to be imposed on parallel lines (after a suitable
mapping). Such mappings exist for wedges with continuous boundaries, but for
discrete boundaries, they have not yet been constructed. In our previous
article, we have overcome this limitation and studied the diffraction of
acoustic waves by a wedge consisting of point scatterers. Here, the problem is
generalised to an arbitrary number of periodic semi-infinite arrays with
arbitrary orientations. This is done by constructing several coupled systems of
equations (one for every semi-infinite array) which are treated independently.
The derived systems of equations are solved using the discrete Wiener-Hopf
technique and the resulting matrix equation is inverted using elementary matrix
arithmetic. Of course, numerically this matrix needs to be truncated, but we
are able to do so such that thousands of scatterers on every array are included
in the numerical results. Comparisons with other numerical methods are
considered, and their strengths/weaknesses are highlighted.

                                        <span>  Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in
quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set
of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well
studied in the literature, namely the unextendible product basis by Bennett et
al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces
explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4
(2004)]. More recently Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)];
Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [arXiv:
2309.05144, (2023)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure
product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing
different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendible product
basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear
spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and
theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain
unextendible product bases, their orthogonal complements, and also
Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces. Finally we give examples of
perturbations with infinitely many pure product states.

                                        <span>  In 1977, Thouless, Anderson, and Palmer (TAP) derived a system of consistent
equations in terms of the effective magnetization in order to study the free
energy in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model. The solutions to
their equations were predicted to contain vital information about the
landscapes in the SK Hamiltonian and the TAP free energy and moreover have
direct connections to Parisi's replica ansatz. In this work, we aim to
investigate the validity of the TAP equations in the generic mixed $p$-spin
model. By utilizing the ultrametricity of the overlaps, we show that the TAP
equations are asymptotically satisfied by the conditional local magnetizations
on the asymptotic pure states.

                                        <span>  We define the notion of strongly interlocked for indecomposable generalized
modules for a vertex operator algebra, and show that the notion of graded
pseudo-trace is well defined for modules which satisfy this property. We prove
that the graded pseudo-trace is a symmetric linear operator that satisfies the
logarithmic derivative property. As an application, we prove that all the
indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the rank one Heisenberg (one
free boson) vertex operator algebras are strongly interlocked, independent of
the choice of conformal vector and thus have well-defined graded pseudo-traces.
We also completely characterize which indecomposable reducible generalized
modules for the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebras induced from the
level zero Zhu algebra are strongly interlocked. In particular, we prove that
the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra with central charge c has
modules induced from the level zero Zhu algebra with conformal weight h that
are strongly interlocked if and only if either (c,h) is outside the extended
Kac table, or the central charge is either c = 1 or 25, the conformal weight
satisfies a certain property, and the level zero Zhu algebra module being
induced is determined by a Jordan block of size less than a certain specified
parameter. We give several examples of graded pseudo-traces for Heisenberg and
Virasoro strongly interlocked modules.

The initial motivation was to generate a scalar field, required to stabilise
the electroweak vacuum and fit the Higgs mass, while respecting the first-order
condition. Ultimately, it turns out that the truest interest of the twist lies
in a new -- and unexpected -- field of 1-forms, which is related to the
transition from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature.

                                        <span>  We analyse the family of Calabi-Yau varieties attached to four-point fishnet
integrals in two dimensions. We find that the Picard-Fuchs operators for
fishnet integrals are exterior powers of the Picard-Fuchs operators for ladder
integrals. This implies that the periods of the Calabi-Yau varieties for
fishnet integrals can be written as determinants of periods for ladder
integrals. The representation theory of the geometric monodromy group plays an
important role in this context. We then show how the determinant form of the
periods immediately leads to the well-known Basso-Dixon formula for four-point
fishnet integrals in two dimensions. Notably, the relation to Calabi-Yau
geometry implies that the volume is also expressible via a determinant formula
of Basso-Dixon type. Finally, we show how the fishnet integrals can be written
in terms of iterated integrals naturally attached to the Calabi-Yau varieties.

generic classical spectral curve with smooth ramification points and simply
ramified away from poles. For this purpose, we build both the associated
quantum curve, i.e.~the differential operator quantizing the algebraic equation
defining the classical spectral curve considered, and a basis of wave
functions, that is to say a basis of solutions of the corresponding
differential equation. We further build a Lax pair representing the resulting
quantum curve and thus present it as a point in an associated space of
meromorphic connections on the Riemann sphere, a first step towards
isomonodromic deformations. We finally propose two examples: the derivation of
a 2-parameter family of formal trans-series solutions to Painlev\'e 2 equation
and the quantization of a degree three spectral curve with pole only at
infinity.

product of two weighted projective spaces given by $
\mathbb{WP}^{4}(\omega,1,1,1,1) \times\mathbb{P}^{1}$. First, we determine the
allowed electric charge regions of the BPS and non BPS black holes obtained by
wrapping M2-branes on appropriate two cycles in such a proposed Calabi-Yau
three-fold. After that, we calculate the entropy of these solutions which takes
a maximal value corresponding to $\omega=1$ defining the ordinary projective
space $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. For generic values of $\omega$, we show that the non
BPS states are unstable. Then, we conduct a similar study of five dimensional
black strings. Concerning the allowed magnetic charge regions of the BPS and
non BPS black stringy solutions derived from M5-branes on dual divisors, we
calculate the tension taking a minimal value for $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. By
determining the recombination factor, we show that the non-BPS black string
states are stable in the allowed regions in the magnetic charge space.

                                        <span>  We investigate possible configurations for vacuum multi-black holes that
maintain static equilibrium in expanding bubbles. Our analysis assumes a
five-dimensional Weyl metric to describe the spacetime, facilitating the
derivation of solutions based on the provided rod structure. We consider a
spacetime having expanding bubbles caused by one or two acceleration horizons,
and show that various configurations such as two bubbles, four bubbles devoid
of horizons, a black saturn, a black di-ring, a bicycling black ring
(orthogonal black di-ring), and a five-dimensional black hole binary can
achieve equilibrium within expanding bubbles. Specifically, we demonstrate that
equilibrium requires two acceleration horizons on both sides for the bicycling
ring and the five-dimensional black hole binary. However, only one acceleration
horizon is necessary for achieving equilibrium in the case of the black saturn
and the black di-ring.

realm momentum space might be curved, mainly focusing, especially for what
concerns phenomenological implications, on the case of a de Sitter momentum
space. We here take as starting point the known fact that quantum gravity
coupled to matter in $2+1$ spacetime dimensions gives rise to an effective
picture characterized by a momentum space with anti-de Sitter geometry, and we
point out some key properties of $2+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum
space. We observe that it is impossible to implement all of these properties in
theories with a $3+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum space, and we then
investigate, with the aim of providing guidance to the relevant phenomenology
focusing on possible modified laws of conservation of momenta, the implications
of giving up, in the $3+1$-dimensional case, some of the properties of the
$2+1$-dimensional case.

Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential
divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal
submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear
combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal
submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic
$Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing
results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a
decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over
compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in
dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact
even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.

                                        <span>  The most natural first-order PDE's to be imposed on a Cayley 4-form in eight
dimensions is the condition that it is closed. As is known, this implies
integrability of the Spin(7) structure defined by the Cayley form, as well as
Ricci-flatness of the associated metric. We address the question as to what the
most natural second-order in derivatives set of conditions is. We start by
constructing the most general diffeomorphism invariant second order in
derivatives Lagrangian that is quadratic in the perturbations of the Cayley
form. We find that there is a one-parameter family of such Lagrangians. We then
describe a non-linear completion of the linear story. To this end, we
parametrise the intrinsic torsion of a Spin(7) structure by a 3-form, and show
that this 3-form is completely determined by the exterior derivative of the
Cayley form. We construct an action functional, which depends on the Cayley
4-form and and auxiliary 3-form as independent variables. There is a unique
functional whose Euler-Lagrange equation for the auxiliary 3-form states that
it is equal to the torsion 3-form. There is, however, a more general
one-parameter family of functionals that can be constructed, and we show how
the linearisation of these functionals reproduces the linear story. For any
member of our family of theories, the Euler-Lagrange equations are written only
using the operator of exterior differentiation of forms, and do not require the
knowledge of the metric-compatible Levi-Civita connection. Geometrically, there
is a preferred member in the family of Lagrangians, and we propose that its
Euler-Lagrange equations are the most natural second-order equations to be
satisfied by Cayley forms. Our construction also leads to a natural geometric
flow in the space of Cayley forms, defined as the gradient flow of our action
functional.

the Bousso bound) in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant gravitational theories.
We focus on theories for which the higher derivative terms are considered as
small corrections in the Lagrangian to Einstein's two-derivative theory of
general relativity (GR). Even if the higher derivative corrections are treated
perturbatively, we provide instances of specific configurations for which they
can potentially violate the Bousso bound. To tackle this obstruction, we
propose a modification in the Bousso bound that incorporates the offending
contributions from the higher derivative corrections. Our proposed
modifications are equivalent to replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking area term by
Wald's definition (with dynamical corrections as suggested by Wall) for the
black hole entropy. Hence, the modifications are physically well motivated by
results from the laws of black hole mechanics in higher derivative theories.

                                        <span>  We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in
arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the
classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton
emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on
the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic
quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum
Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in
the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained
for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At
the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to
the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires
non-minimal couplings. In $D>4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems
implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different
topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on
the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress
quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover
the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third
and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with
the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal
coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of
scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum
solutions only in $D=4$.

                                        <span>  The interaction of a gravitational wave (GW) with an elastic body is usually
described in terms of a GW "force" driving the oscillations of the body's
normal modes. However, this description is only possible for GW frequencies for
which the response of the elastic body is dominated by a few normal modes. At
higher frequencies the normal modes blend into a quasi-continuum and a
field-theoretical description, as pioneered by Dyson already in 1969, becomes
necessary. However, since the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ is an
intrinsically relativistic object, a consistent coupling to GWs can only be
obtained within a relativistic (and, in fact generally covariant) theory of
elasticity. We develop such a formalism using the methods of modern effective
field theories, and we use it to provide a derivation of the interaction of
elastic bodies with GWs valid also in the high-frequency regime, providing a
first-principle derivation of Dyson's result (and partially correcting it). We
also stress that the field-theoretical results are obtained working in the TT
frame, while the description in terms of a force driving the normal modes is
only valid in the proper detector frame. We show how to transform the results
between the two frames. Beside an intrinsic conceptual interest, these results
are relevant to the computation of the sensitivity of the recently proposed
Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna.

for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion
charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field
flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only
in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity
equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of
on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends
itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d
super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric
super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.

across all four regions in the Rindler coordinates in the Lorentz covariant
gauge. In the four regions (future, past, left and right Rindler-wedges) in the
Rindler coordinates, defining the gauge-fixed Lagrangian in the Lorentz
covariant gauge, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field, the $B$-field and
ghost fields. Since the U(1) gauge and $B$-fields are decoupled from the ghost
fields by the property of the U(1) gauge theory, the U(1) gauge field and the
$B$-field are examined in this study.
  Then, by solving the equations of motion obtained from the gauge-fixed
Lagrangian, the solutions of each mode of the U(1) gauge field and the
$B$-field can be obtained. Following this, with the Klein-Gordon inner-product
defined in the Rindler coordinates, the normalization constants of each of
those mode-solutions are determined.
  Subsequently, formulating the canonical commutation relations of the U(1)
gauge field and its canonical conjugate momentum, the commutation relations of
the coefficient of each mode-solution in each direction of the U(1) gauge field
in each region of the Rindler coordinates are obtained. From these, it can be
seen that those coefficients have physical meaning as creation/annihilation
operators. The polarization vectors in each region of the Rindler coordinates
are also given in this study.
  From these, it is shown that the Minkowski ground state can be given as the
outer-product of the quantum states multiplied by the creation operators of the
U(1) gauge field in the left and right Rindler-wedge states.
  Then, obtaining the density matrix of the U(1) gauge theory in the right
Rindler-wedge from that, it is shown that the U(1) gauge field in the constant
accelerated system feels the Unruh temperature as well.

                                        <span>  We study the structure of static spherical stars composed of non-relativistic
matter in linear massive gravity with or without the Fierz-Pauli (FP) tuning.
Adopting a polytropic equation of state, we construct master differential
equations for the stellar profile function, which is fourth order in the FP
theory or sixth order in generic non-FP theories, where the difference in the
differential order reflects the presence of a ghost spin-0 graviton in the
latter. In both cases, even when the spin-0 ghost is present, we find exact
solutions with finite radius for the polytropic indices n = 0 and 1. Analyzing
the dependences of the stellar radius, mass, and Yukawa charge on the graviton
masses, we observe that a discontinuous behavior arises in the massless limit
of the FP theory similarly to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity, while
it is absent in non-FP theories. We discuss rough observational constraints on
the graviton masses.

$80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with
cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including
scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing
the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory
including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$
dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of
equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and
discussed.

                                        <span>  We study the four-point correlator $\langle \mathcal{O}_2 \mathcal{O}_2
\mathcal{D} \mathcal{D} \rangle$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory
(SYM) with $SU(N)$ gauge group, where $\mathcal{O}_2$ represents the
superconformal primary operator with dimension two, while $\mathcal{D}$ denotes
a determinant operator of dimension $N$, which is holographically dual to a
giant graviton D3-brane extending along $S^5$. We analyse the integrated
correlator associated with this observable, obtained after integrating out the
spacetime dependence over a supersymmetric invariant measure. Similarly to
other classes of integrated correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, this integrated
correlator can be computed through supersymmetric localisation on the
four-sphere. Employing matrix-model recursive techniques, we demonstrate that
the integrated correlator can be reformulated as an infinite sum of protected
three-point functions with known coefficients. This insight allows us to
circumvent the complexity associated with the dimension-$N$ determinant
operator, significantly streamlining the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated
correlator. In the planar limit and beyond, we derive exact results for the
integrated correlator valid for all values of the 't Hooft coupling, and
investigate the resurgent properties of their strong coupling expansion.
Additionally, in the large-$N$ expansion with fixed (complexified) Yang-Mills
coupling, we deduce the $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ completion of these results in
terms of the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. The proposed modular functions
are confirmed by explicit instanton calculations from the matrix model, and
agree with expectations from the holographic dual picture of known results in
type IIB string theory.

that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance

properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem
establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV

numerous examples.

representation of the braid group and Temperley-Lieb algebra. The pseudounitary
representation that we consider allows constructing ``states'' from the
group/algebra matrices and compute the knot invariants as matrix elements,
rather than traces. In comparison with a more standard way of computing the
invariants through traces, the matrix element method is more interesting and
complete from the point of view of applications. As a byproduct of the
discussion we prove a general formula for pretzel knots.

                                        <span>  We investigate the phenomenon of electron-positron pair production from
vacuum in the presence of a uniform time-dependent electric field of arbitrary
polarization. Taking into account the interaction with the external classical
background in a nonperturbative manner, we quantize the electron-positron field
and derive a system of ten quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) showing that the
previously-used QKEs are incorrect once the external field rotates in space. We
employ then the Wigner-function formalism of the field quantization and
establish a direct connection between the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW)
approach to investigating the vacuum pair-production process and the QKEs. We
provide a self-contained description of the two theoretical frameworks
rigorously proving their equivalence and present an exact one-to-one
correspondence between the kinetic functions involved within the two
techniques. Special focus is placed on the analysis of the spin effects in the
final particle distributions.

                                        <span>  The efforts in this contribution consist in reassessing a modified Dirac
equation that incorporates a $\gamma^0 \gamma_5$-Lorentz-symmetry violating
(LSV) term induced as a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effect. Originally, this
equation has been applied and considered as a good scenario for describing a
number of investigations on the flight time of cosmic photons and neutrinos,
which suggests that the speed of light in vacuum, in connection with the
geometry that describes a granular space-time, takes an energy-dependent form,
e.g., $v(E) =1 \pm E/E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}}$, with $E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}}
\approx 6,5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV for neutrinos. Once LQG provides a viable way
to consistently understand this picture, we pursue an analysis of this
effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the
derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon
decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to
obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic
limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent
corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified
Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime. The study of the form factors may
open up paths to set up bounds on the LQG parameters from the precision
measurements of electromagnetic attributes of the charged leptons, such as
their respective electric and magnetic dipole moments.

                                        <span>  We consider the insertion of a Gukov-Witten surface defect in
$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM corresponding to a probe D3-brane in the
holographic dual setup. The defect gives rise to a $4d$-$2d$ coupled system
encoding the entropy of the dual perturbed black hole, which can be extracted
from the corresponding Superconformal Index. Elaborating on previous studies,
we refine the results using both a saddle-point and a Bethe-Ansatz approach.
The consistency of our computation is corroborated by the complete agreement
between the two results in the appropriate regime of fugacities. Eventually,
the sub-leading structure, emerging from our analysis, provides a suggestive
EFT interpretation for the addition of the defect to the $4d$ system, mirroring
the behavior of the probe D3-brane in the gravity dual.

formulation. We revisit the derivation of the finite-temperature Schwarzian
action in the conformal gauge of the bosonic JT gravity through wiggling
boundary and the frame fluctuation descriptions. Extending our method to
$\mathcal{N}=1$ JT supergravity, we derive the finite-temperature
super-Schwarzian action for the edge mode from both the wiggling boundary and
the superframe field fluctuation. We emphasize the crucial role of the
supersymmetric version of the inversion formula in elucidating the relation
between the isometry and the $OSp(2|1)$ gauging of the super-Schwarzian action.
In $osp(2|1)$ BF formulation, we discuss the asymptotic AdS condition. We
employ the Iwasawa-like decomposition of $OSp(2|1)$ group element to derive the
super-Schwarzian action at finite temperature. We demonstrate that the
$OSp(2|1)$ gauging arises from inherent redundancy in the Iwasawa-like
decomposition. We also discuss the path integral measure obtained from the Haar
measure of $OSp(2|1)$.

                                        <span>  We present here the first numerical test of symplectic quantization, a new
approach to quantum field theory. Symplectic quantization is characterized by
the possibility to sample quantum fluctuations of relativistic fields by means
of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations, the latter
evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$. In the present
work we study numerically the symplectic quantization dynamics for a real
scalar field in 1+1 space-time dimensions and with $\lambda \phi^4$ non-linear
interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the Fourier spectrum of the
two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively
well the shape of the Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the
expectation over quantum fluctuations is computed as a dynamical average along
the trajectories parametrized by the intrinsic time $\tau$. As a numerical
strategy to study quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Lorentzian
space-time, we believe that symplectic quantization will be of key importance
for the study of non-equilibrium relaxational dynamics in quantum field theory
and the phenomenology of metastable bound states with very short life-time,
something usually not accessible by numerical methods based on Euclidean field
theory.

decouple from gravity. Nevertheless, it is possible to construct fine-tuned
exact solutions that activate low-spin fields without sourcing the higher-spin
fields. We show that BPST (Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin) instanton is an
exact solution of Chiral Higher Spin Gravity, i.e. it is also a solution of the
holographic dual of Chern-Simons matter theories. This gives an example of a
low-spin solution. The instanton sources the opposite helicity spin-one field
and a scalar field. We derive an Effective Field Theory that describes the
coupling between an instanton and the other two fields, whose action starts
with the Chalmers-Siegel action and has certain higher derivative couplings.

data, including when the exact ADHM data is unknown. The configurations look
like clusters of smaller skyrmions, and can be used to build manifolds of

these manifolds. We describe the construction and quantisation procedure

theories in Beltrami parametrisation (Kodaira-Spencer anomalies) are computed
in the BRST framework, using an extension of the Stora-Zumino method. This
method, which allows to compute anomalies in a very concise way, makes manifest
the topological origin of anomalies. They have a clear geometric
interpretation, since they are expressed in terms of Chern polynomials and
Pontryagin invariants. The key ingredient is the formulation of the BRST
transformations in terms of polyforms, whose total degree is the sum of the
form degree and of the ghost number. This approach simplifies significantly the
analysis available in literature and it allows to compute many other solutions.
Namely, an anomaly, which was computed using different methods, is proved to be
a consistent BRST anomaly, disproving a conclusion in a previous analysis.

order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with
the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently
(arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide
analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations,
together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable
perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared
suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor
with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice
investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in
the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop
contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point
correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall
constant factor.

                                        <span>  The global Schwinger formula, introduced by Cachazo and Early as a single
integral over the positive tropical Grassmannian, provides a way to uncover
properties of scattering amplitudes which are hard to see in their standard
Feynman diagram formulation. In a recent work, Cachazo and one of the authors
extended the global Schwinger formula to general $\phi^p$ theories. When $p=4$,
it was conjectured that the integral decomposes as a sum over cones which are
in bijection with non-crossing chord diagrams, and further that these can be
obtained by finding the zeroes of a piece-wise linear function, $H(x)$. In this
note we give a proof of this conjecture. We also present a purely combinatorial
way of computing $\phi^p$ amplitudes by triangulating a trivial extended
version of non-crossing $(p-2)$-chord diagrams, called extended diagrams, and
present a proof of the bijection between triangulated extended diagrams and
Feynman diagrams when $p=4$. This is reminiscent of recent constructions using
Stokes polytopes and accordiohedra. However, the $\phi^p$ amplitude is now
partitioned by a new collection of objects, each of which characterizes a
polyhedral cone in the positive tropical Grassmannian in the form of an
associahedron or of an intersection of two associahedra. Moreover, we comment
on the bijection between extended diagrams and double-ordered biadjoint scalar
amplitudes. We also conjecture the form of the general piece-wise linear
function, $H^{\phi^p}(x)$, whose zeroes generate the regions in which the
$\phi^p$ global Schwinger formula decomposes into.

matrix can leak into the scalar potential of the real two-Higgs-doublet model
(2HDM) via divergent radiative corrections, thereby spoiling the
renormalizability of the model. We show that any contributing diagram must
involve 12 Yukawa-coupling insertions and a factor of the $U(1)_{PQ}$-breaking
scalar potential parameter $\lambda_5$, thereby requiring at least six loops;
this also implies that the 2HDM with only softly-broken $U(1)_{PQ}$ is safe
from divergent leaks of CP violation to all orders. We demonstrate that
additional symmetries of the six-loop diagrams in the type I and II 2HDMs
guarantee that all of the divergent CP-violating contributions cancel at this
order. We also show that these symmetries are violated at seven loops and
enumerate the classes of diagrams that can contribute to CP-violating
divergences, providing evidence that the real 2HDM is theoretically
inconsistent starting at the seven-loop level.

Euclidean path integral, with asymptotically $AdS$ boundary conditions. In the
semiclassical limit, it describes a Euclidean (half)-wormhole geometry,
exhibiting a local maximum of the scale factor at the surface of reflection
symmetry, giving rise to an expanding universe upon analytic continuation to
Lorentzian signature. We find that these Euclidean wormholes set natural
initial conditions for inflation and that the semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt
wavefunction can favor a long lasting inflationary epoch, resolving a well
known issue of the no-boundary proposal. Due to the asymptotic $AdS$ conditions
in the Euclidean past they raise the possibility of describing the physics of
inflating cosmologies and their perturbations within the context of holography.

configurations of sevenbranes, such that the string coupling $g_s$ is fixed to
a constant finite value. These are the simplest realizations of F-theory, and
are holographically dual to rank $N$ Argyres-Douglas conformal field theories
(CFTs) with $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ flavor groups, and Minahan-Nemeschansky CFTs
with $E_6, E_7$ and $E_8$ flavor groups. We use the Seiberg-Witten curves of
these theories to compute the mass deformed sphere free energy $F(m)$ at large
$N$ in terms of novel matrix models with non-polynomial potentials. We show how
$F(m)$ can be used along with the analytic bootstrap to fix the large $N$
expansion of flavor multiplet correlators in these CFTs, which are dual to
scattering of gluons on $AdS_5\times S^3$, and in the flat space limit
determine the effective theory of sevenbranes in F-theory. As a first step in
this program, we use the matrix models to compute the $\log N$ term in $F(m)$
and thereby fix the logarithmic threshold in the $AdS_5\times S^3$ holographic
correlator, which matches the flat space prediction.

                                        <span>  Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a
strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are
produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced
on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such
primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the
scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The
recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the
pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing
the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are
assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the
mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to
explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In
this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power
spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary
GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of
radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the
conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs
produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the
scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper
equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a
stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs
produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.

                                        <span>  Chiral magnetohydrodynamics is devoted to understanding the late-time and
long-distance behavior of a system with an Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly at finite
temperatures. The non-conservation of the axial charge is determined by the
topological density $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$; in a classical hydrodynamic
description this decay rate can be suppressed by tuning the background magnetic
field to zero. However it is in principle possible for thermal fluctuations of
$\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$ to result in a non-conservation of the charge even at
vanishing $B$-field; this would invalidate the classical hydrodynamic effective
theory. We investigate this by computing the real-time susceptibility of the
topological density at one-loop level in magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations,
relating its low-frequency limit to the decay rate of the axial charge. We find
that the frequency-dependence of this susceptibility is sufficiently soft as to
leave the axial decay rate unaffected, validating the classical hydrodynamic
description. We show that the susceptibility contains non-analytic
frequency-dependence which is universally determined by hydrodynamic data. We
comment briefly on possible connections to the recent formulation of the ABJ
anomaly in terms of non-invertible symmetry.

topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has
a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to
intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in two different ways,
Hurwitz numbers and quantum curves. The same method is used to establish
analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the

                                        <span>  Generalizations of coordinate $x$-momentum $p_x$ Uncertainty Principle, with
$\Delta x$ and $\Delta p_x$ dependent terms ($\Delta$ denoting standard
deviation), $$\Delta x \Delta p_x\geq i\hbar (1+\alpha\Delta p_x^2 +\beta
\Delta x^2)$$ have provided rich dividends as a poor person's approach towards
Quantum Gravity, because these can introduce coordinate and momentum scales
($\alpha,\beta$ ) that are appealing conceptually. However, these extensions of
Uncertainty Principle are purely phenomenological in nature. Apart from the
inherent ambiguity in their explicit structures, the introduction of
generalized commutations relations compatible with the Uncertainty Principle
has serious drawbacks.
  In the present paper we reveal that these generalized Uncertainty Principles
can appear in a perfectly natural way, in canonical quantum mechanics, if one
assumes a periodic nature in coordinate or momentum space, as the case may be.
We bring in to light quite old, (but no so well known), works by Judge and by
Judge and Lewis, that explains in detail how the popularly known structure of
Extended Uncertainty Principle is generated in the case of angle $\phi$ angular
momentum $L_z$, $$\Delta \phi \Delta L_z \geq i\hbar (1 +\nu \Delta \phi^2)$$
purely from a consistent implementation of periodic nature of the angle
variable $\phi $, without changing the $\phi, L_z$ canonical commutation
relation. We directly apply this formalism to construction to formulate
generalizations in $\Delta x \Delta p_x $ Uncertainty Principle. We identify
$\beta$ with an observed length scale relevant in astrophysics context. We
speculate about the $\alpha$ extension.

gluon vertex in the Nambu-Gorkov basis which is widely applied to study the
color superconductivity. After considering the non-Abelian feature in the
off-diagonal part of quark gluon vertex, we acquire a quark pairing gap in
chiral limit above the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$. The gap
persists up to $2-3\,T_c$ and vanishes at higher temperature. Such a quark
pairing characterizes the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma phase as a new
phase and distinct from the phase with quasi quarks and gluons. Its new

for vacuum tensor perturbations at the level of the effective action, adopting
Hadamard regularization techniques to isolate short distance divergences and
gauge fixing via the Faddeev-Popov procedure. The subsequently derived
renormalized stress tensor can be related to more familiar forms reliant upon
an averaging prescription, such as the Isaacson or Misner-Thorne-Wheeler forms.
The latter, however, are premised on a prior scale separation (beyond which the
averaging is invoked) and therefore unsuited for the purposes of
renormalization. This can lead to potentially unphysical conclusions when taken
as a starting point for the computation of any observable that needs
regularization, such as the energy density associated to a stochastic
background. Any averaging prescription, if needed, should only be invoked at
the end of the renormalization procedure. The latter necessarily involves the
imposition of renormalization conditions via a physical measurement at some
fixed scale, which we retrace for primordial gravitational waves sourced from
vacuum fluctuations through direct or indirect observation.

fluxes. We show that a theory including arbitrary fluxes can always be studied
in a theory involving only diagonal fluxes by appropriate coordinate
transformations. It is found that the number of independent magnetic fluxes is
equal to the rank of the classical value of the field strength matrix, ${\rm
rank}\langle F\rangle$. The number of massless zero modes induced from extra
components of higher-dimensional gauge field (Wilson-line scalar field), is
also determined by ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. We explicitly confirm that the
quantum corrections due to the matter fermion to the squared mass of
Wilson-line scalar field cancel out at one-loop level. For this purpose, we
derive the fermion mass spectrum on $M^4\times T^4$ with arbitrary fluxes. By
taking the flux diagonal basis, creation and annihilation operators for
Kaluza-Klein quantum numbers are defined appropriately. Our results are easily
generalized to the case of $M^4\times T^{2n}~(n\geq3)$.

symmetry acts on the 't~Hooft line operator in the $U(1)$ gauge theory by
employing the modified Villain-type lattice formulation. We model the axial
anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance,
the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the
dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge
fields. The anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity with the dressing factor shows
that, when the symmetry operator sweep out a 't~Hooft loop, the loop acquires a
surface operator of the $U(1)$ field strength with a correction of a higher cup
product. This result appears consistent with the phenomenon observed in the
continuum theory. A similar analysis for the axion string operator shows that
it is not affected by the symmetry operator.

distinct dark matter halo profiles to test the possibility of generalised
wormhole geometry within the galactic halo regions. The current study aims to
accomplish these goals by examining various dark matter profiles including
Universal Rotation Curves (URC), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model-I, and NFW
model-II inside two distinct $f(R, L_m)$ gravity models. According to the $f(R,
L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m^\alpha$ model, the DM halo density profiles produce
suitable shape functions that meet all the necessary requirements for
exhibiting the wormhole geometries with appropriate choice of free parameters.
In addition, to examine DM profiles under the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + (1 +
\lambda R)L_m$ model, we consider a specific shape function. Further, we
observed that the derived solution from both two models violates the null
energy constraints, confirming that the DM supports wormholes to maintain in
the galactic halo.

within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent
era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to
focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to
observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last
mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each
mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the
additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement
entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume
term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late
times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the
magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the
quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation.
Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting
fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during
inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an
observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would
interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after
inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.

                                        <span>  In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing
hydrodynamic formalisms, which in order to be causal and stable, (i) either
requires to promote the `non-fluid' variables as the new degrees of freedom
apart from the velocity and temperature, or (ii) needs to be in a general
hydrodynamic frame other than the ones given by Landau and Eckart. We have
rewritten the BDNK stress tensor (originally in the general frame) into the
Landau frame by redefining the fluid variables such as velocity ($u^{\mu}$) and
temperature ($T$) via a hydrodynamic frame transformation. This `fluid frame'
transformation includes shift variables $\delta u^{\mu}$ and $\delta T$, which
are small enough to be treated linearly but encompass all orders of gradient
corrections. The redefinition indicates that though the BDNK formalism has a
finite number of derivatives, in the Landau frame, it will either have an
infinite number of derivatives or one has to resum them by introducing new
`non-fluid' variables much like the MIS theory. The infinite derivative series
are summed in two different ways that lead to two different methods of
`integrating in' new `non-fluid' variables, showing the non-uniqueness of the
process of `integrating in' new variables. Finally, the dispersion relations
and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations
have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are
indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.

                                        <span>  It is well known that the Einstein-Hilbert action in two dimensions is
topological and yields an identically vanishing Einstein tensor. Consequently
one is faced with difficulties when formulating a non-trivial gravity model. We
present a new, intrinsically two-dimensional, approach to this problem based on
the Einstein action. This yields a well defined variational approach which
results in new field equations that break diffeomorphism invariance. Our
proposed approach does not require the introduction of additional scalar
fields, nor the use of conformal transformations. However, we can show how
including conformal counter terms leads to equivalent results. In doing so, we
can provide an explanation for why previous approaches worked. Solutions to the
field equations are briefly discussed.

                                        <span>  We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills
theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global
symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as
well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold
gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral
methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge
theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields
for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive
reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those
orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and
relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We
extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries
of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized
$\theta$-angle.

                                        <span>  Recently, the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported the
evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hertz
band. The spectrum of inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) is unknown, which
might exhibit different power law at different frequency-bands, thus if the PTA
signal is primordial, it will be significant to explore the underlying
implications of current PTA and CMB data on IGW. In this paper, we perform a
joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for a broken power-law spectrum of IGW
with the NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data. It is found that though the
bestfit spectral tilt of IGW at PTA band is $n^\text{PTA}_\text{T}
=2.42^{+0.32}_{-0.91}$, at CMB band the bestfit is $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T}
=0.55^{+0.37}_{-0.10}$ while a detectable amplitude of $r$ with
$n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} \simeq 0$ is still compatible. The implication of our
results for inflation is also discussed.

solutions of charged black holes, which are neither asymptotically flat nor

entropy, verify the valid of first law of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover,
we further investigate the critical behaviors of these black holes in grand
canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble, respectively, and find that there is
a new and novel critical phenomenon which is never found before, called
``reversed" reentrant phase transition with a tricritical point. It implies
that the system undergoes a novel ``SBH-LBH-SBH" phase transition process, and
is the reverse of the ``LBH-SBH-LBH" process observed in reentrant phase

a class of Lie algebras encoding the symmetries of spacetime. Homogeneous
spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated to these possible
kinematics can be partitioned into four families -- riemannian, lorentzian,
galilean and carrollian -- based on the type of invariant metric structure they
admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics -- defined as
extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal -- as well as their
associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along
the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient
Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique -- trivial and
torsion-free -- higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are
constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein
pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its
curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically
allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation
between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian
Klein pairs.

                                        <span>  The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of
the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by
compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019,
surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular
forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive
array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural
questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the
different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular
forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group
$SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular
forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form
structure by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with
supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued
quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat
Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it
was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat
Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold,
suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by
providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite
family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third,
we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type
invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator
algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of
logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.

angular-momentum current flux density for a scalar field in the Unruh state
near the inner horizon of a Kerr-de Sitter black hole. Our results indicate
that this flux diverges as $V_-^{-1}$ in a suitable Kruskal coordinate such
that $V_-=0$ at the inner horizon. Depending on the parameter values of the
scalar field and black hole that we consider, and depending on the polar angle
(latitude), this flux can have different signs. In the near extremal cases
considered, the angle average of the expectation value of the quantum angular
momentum current flux is of the opposite sign as the angular momentum of the
background itself, suggesting that, in the cases considered, quantum effects
tend to decrease the total angular momentum of the spheres away from the
extremal value. We also numerically calculate the energy flux component, which
provides the leading order divergence of the quantum stress energy tensor,
dominant over the classical stress energy tensor, at the inner horizon. Taking
our expectation value of the quantum stress tensor as the source in the
semiclassical Einstein equation, our analysis suggests that the spheres
approaching the inner horizon can undergo an infinite twisting due to quantum
effects along latitudes separating regions of infinite expansion and
contraction.

quantum paradigm has challenged the scientific community for a century today. A
mechanism of gravitational self-interaction, governed by the so-called
Schroedinger-Newton equation, is among the proposals that aim to shed some
light on it. Despite all efforts, this mechanism has been proven difficult to
probe. Here, we consider a simple Stern-Gerlach-like experiment to try it out.
The Schroedinger-Newton equation can be analytically solved under certain
proper conditions, and a dephasing effect induced by the gravitational
self-interacting potential can be calculated.

$D=2,3,4$ via the numerical bootstrap method. It combines the Makeenko-Migdal
loop equations, with a cut-off $L_{\mathrm{max}}$ on the maximal length of
loops, and positivity conditions on certain matrices of Wilson loops. Our
algorithm is inspired by the pioneering paper of P.Anderson and M.Kruczenski
but it is significantly more efficient, as it takes into account the symmetries
of the lattice theory and uses the relaxation procedure in line with our
previous work on matrix bootstrap. We thus obtain rigorous upper and lower
bounds on the plaquette average at various couplings and dimensions. For $D=4$,
the lower bound data appear to be close to the MC data in the strong coupling
phase and the upper bound data in the weak coupling phase reproduce well the
3-loop perturbation theory. Our results suggest that this bootstrap approach
can provide a tangible alternative to the, so far uncontested, Monte Carlo
approach.

partition function for surfaces with holomorphic 2-form. The conjecture is
based on $S$-duality and a structure formula for the vertical contribution
previously derived by the third-named author using Gholampour-Thomas's theory
of virtual degeneracy loci.
  For ranks $r=2,3$, conjectural expressions for the partition function in
terms of the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$ and Seiberg-Witten
invariants were known. We conjecture new expressions for $r=4,5$ in terms of
the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$, Seiberg-Witten invariants,
and continued fractions studied by Ramanujan. The vertical part of our
conjectures is proved for low virtual dimensions by calculations on nested
Hilbert schemes.
  The horizontal part of our conjectures gives predictions for virtual Euler
characteristics of Gieseker-Maruyama moduli spaces of stable sheaves. In this
case, our formulae are sums of universal functions with coefficients in Galois
extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. The universal functions, corresponding to different
quantum vacua, are permuted under the action of the Galois group.
  For $r=6, 7$ we also find relations with Hauptmoduln of $\Gamma_0(r)$. We
present $K$-theoretic refinements for $r=2,3,4$ involving weak Jacobi forms.

an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom
on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one
approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of
freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called
``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in
earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same
universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate
the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient
for quantum simulations.

                                        <span>  We construct combinatorial analogs of 2d higher topological quantum field
theories. We consider triangulations as vertices of a certain CW complex $\Xi$.
In the "flip theory," cells of $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ correspond to polygonal
decompositions obtained by erasing the edges in a triangulation. These theories
assign to a cobordism $\Sigma$ a cochain $Z$ on $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ constructed
as a contraction of structure tensors of a cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra $V$
assigned to polygons. The cyclic $A_\infty$ equations imply the closedness
equation $(\delta+Q)Z=0$. In this context we define combinatorial BV operators
and give examples with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the "secondary
polytope theory," $\Xi_\mathrm{sp}$ is the secondary polytope (due to
Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky) and the cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra has to be
replaced by an appropriate refinement that we call an $\widehat{A}_\infty$
algebra. We conjecture the existence of a good Pachner CW complex $\Xi$ for any
cobordism, whose local combinatorics is descibed by secondary polytopes and the
homotopy type is that of Zwiebach's moduli space of complex structures.
Depending on this conjecture, one has an "ideal model" of combinatorial 2d
HTQFT determined by a local $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra.

S^3\times T^4$ of Lloyd, Ohlsson Sax, Sfondrini, and Stefa\'nski at $k=1$. We
discuss the map in the absence of RR fluxes, when the theory is free, and at
small RR flux, $h\ll 1$, where the symmetric-orbifold CFT is deformed by a
marginal operator from the twist-two sector. We discuss the recent results of
Gaberdiel, Gopakumar, and Nairz, who computed from the perturbed
symmetric-product orbifold the central extension to the symmetry algebra of the
theory and its coproduct. We show that it coincides with the $h\ll 1$ expansion
of the lightcone symmetry algebra known from worldsheet integrability, and that
hence the S matrix found by Gaberdiel, Gopakumar, and Nairz maps to the one
bootstrapped by the worldsheet integrability approach.

                                        <span>  Quasinormal modes and frequencies are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a
non-Hermitian differential operator. They hold crucial significance in the
physics of black holes. The analysis of quasinormal modes of black holes in
asymptotically Anti-de Sitter geometries plays also a key role in the study of
strongly coupled quantum many-body systems via gauge/gravity duality. In
contrast to normal Sturm-Liouville operators, the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian
(and non-normal) operators generally exhibit instability under small
perturbations. This research focuses on the stability analysis of quasinormal
frequencies pertaining to asymptotically planar AdS black holes, employing
pseudospectrum analysis. Specifically, we concentrate on the pseudospectra of
scalar and transverse gauge fields, shedding light on their relevance within
the framework of gauge/gravity duality.

                                        <span>  We study 3d quantum gravity with two asymptotically anti-de Sitter regions,
in particular, using its relation with coupled Alekseev-Shatashvili theories
and Liouville theory. Expressions for the Hartle-Hawking state, thermal
$2n$-point functions, torus wormhole correlators and Wheeler-DeWitt
wavefunctions in different bases are obtained using the ZZ boundary states in
Liouville theory. Exact results in 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity are
uplifted to 3d gravity, with two copies of Liouville theory in 3d gravity
playing a similar role as Schwarzian theory in JT gravity. The connection
between 3d gravity and the Liouville ZZ boundary states are manifested by
viewing BTZ black holes as Maldacena-Maoz wormholes, with the two wormhole
boundaries glued along the ZZ boundaries. In this work, we also study the
factorization problem of the Hartle-Hawking state in 3d gravity. With the
relevant defect operator that imposes the necessary topological constraint for
contractibility, the trace formula in gravity is modified in computing the
entanglement entropy. This trace matches with the one from von Neumann algebra
considerations, further reproducing the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula from
entanglement entropy. Lastly, we propose a calculation for off-shell
geometrical quantities that are responsible for the ramp behavior in the late
time two-point functions, which follows from the understanding of the Liouville
FZZT boundary states in the context of 3d gravity, and the identification
between Verlinde loop operators in Liouville theory and "baby universe"
operators in 3d gravity.

tensions simultaneously. Such a modified cosmological scenario is obtained by
the application of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, but using the
non-additive Tsallis entropy, instead of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking one.
Hence, one obtains modified Friedmann equations, with extra terms that depend
on the new Tsallis exponent $\delta$ that quantifies the departure from
standard entropy. We show that for particular $\delta$ choices we can obtain a
phantom effective dark energy, which is known to be one of the sufficient
mechanisms that can alleviate $H_0$ tension. Additionally, for the same
parameter choice we obtain an increased friction term and an effective Newton's
constant smaller than the usual one, and thus the $\sigma_8$ tension is also
solved. These features act as a significant advantage of Tsallis modified
cosmology.

                                        <span>  We define the notion of strongly interlocked for indecomposable generalized
modules for a vertex operator algebra, and show that the notion of graded
pseudo-trace is well defined for modules which satisfy this property. We prove
that the graded pseudo-trace is a symmetric linear operator that satisfies the
logarithmic derivative property. As an application, we prove that all the
indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the rank one Heisenberg (one
free boson) vertex operator algebras are strongly interlocked, independent of
the choice of conformal vector and thus have well-defined graded pseudo-traces.
We also completely characterize which indecomposable reducible generalized
modules for the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebras induced from the
level zero Zhu algebra are strongly interlocked. In particular, we prove that
the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra with central charge c has
modules induced from the level zero Zhu algebra with conformal weight h that
are strongly interlocked if and only if either (c,h) is outside the extended
Kac table, or the central charge is either c = 1 or 25, the conformal weight
satisfies a certain property, and the level zero Zhu algebra module being
induced is determined by a Jordan block of size less than a certain specified
parameter. We give several examples of graded pseudo-traces for Heisenberg and
Virasoro strongly interlocked modules.

                                        <span>  We investigate the celestial description of an eikonal amplitude for the
scattering of massless scalars mediated by soft gravitons in the near-horizon
region of a large eternal Schwarzschild black hole. Our construction thus
provides a celestial conformal field theory on the horizon corresponding to a
non-perturbative scattering process that accounts for event horizons on
asymptotically flat spacetimes. From the \emph{known} two-dimensional
near-horizon scattering amplitude computed within the effective field theory
framework, we first construct a four-dimensional amplitude in a flat spacetime
frame around the bifurcation sphere strictly in a small angle approximation
limit. While the kinematics of external particles in this frame at leading
order are analogous to a Minkowski spacetime, the eikonal amplitude differs
from those about flat spacetime due to the near-horizon scattering potential.
We construct a celestial correlator following a Mellin transform that provides
an all loop order result, with a universal leading ultraviolet (UV) soft
scaling behavior of the conformally invariant cross-ratio, and an infrared (IR)
pole for the scaling dimension at each loop order. We argue these properties
manifest soft graviton exchanges in the near-horizon region and, consequently,
the soft UV behavior of the amplitude.

from certain rapid-turning and inspiraling trajectories in field space. We find
the speed of sound $c_s$ of the dark energy perturbations around the background
and show that $c_s$ is monotonically decreasing with time. Furthermore, it has
a positive-definite lower bound that implies a certain clustering scale. We
also extend the previously known background solution for dark energy to an
exact solution that includes matter. This allows us to address the implications
of our model for two cosmological tensions. More precisely, we argue that the
$\sigma_8$ tension can be alleviated generically, while reducing the Hubble
tension requires certain constraints on the parameter space of the model.
Notably, a necessary condition for alleviating the Hubble tension is that the
transition from matter domination to the dark energy epoch begins earlier than
in $\Lambda$CDM.

series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees
within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a

                                        <span>  Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic
degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation
using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more
scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for
such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the
quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the
Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one
spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of
measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm
to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we
present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states
using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework.
We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian
based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the
corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with
system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the
gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods
for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied
to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost
resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant
implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical
instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to
improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this
might be achieved.

                                        <span>  According to the preceding studies, the lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with
a single scalar field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group has
a single confinement-Higgs phase where confinement and Higgs regions are
subregions of an analytically continued single phase and there are no
thermodynamic phase transitions, which is a well-known consequence of the
Osterwalder-Seiler-Fradkin-Shenker theorem. In this paper, we show that we can
define new types of gauge-invariant operators by combining the original
fundamental scalar field and the so-called color-direction field which is
obtained by change of field variables based on the gauge-covariant
decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi.
By performing the numerical simulations on the lattice without any gauge
fixing, we reproduce the conventional thermodynamic transition line in the weak
gauge coupling, and moreover we find a new transition line detected by the new
gauge-invariant operators which separates the confinement-Higgs phase into two
parts, confinement phase and the Higgs phase, in the strong gauge coupling. All
results are obtained in the gauge-independent way, since no gauge fixing has
been imposed in the numerical simulations. Moreover, we discuss a physical
interpretation for the new transition from the viewpoint of the realization of
a global symmetry.

integrals in two dimensions. We find that the Picard-Fuchs operators for
fishnet integrals are exterior powers of the Picard-Fuchs operators for ladder
integrals. This implies that the periods of the Calabi-Yau varieties for
fishnet integrals can be written as determinants of periods for ladder
integrals. The representation theory of the geometric monodromy group plays an
important role in this context. We then show how the determinant form of the
periods immediately leads to the well-known Basso-Dixon formula for four-point
fishnet integrals in two dimensions. Notably, the relation to Calabi-Yau
geometry implies that the volume is also expressible via a determinant formula
of Basso-Dixon type. Finally, we show how the fishnet integrals can be written
in terms of iterated integrals naturally attached to the Calabi-Yau varieties.

                                        <span>  Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical
point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum
field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a
new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond
the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase
transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance,
in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP
between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as
first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible
with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is
exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its
entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the
current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior
persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study
the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale
quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$
smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists
in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models
do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a
finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are
consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the
Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.

generic classical spectral curve with smooth ramification points and simply
ramified away from poles. For this purpose, we build both the associated
quantum curve, i.e.~the differential operator quantizing the algebraic equation
defining the classical spectral curve considered, and a basis of wave
functions, that is to say a basis of solutions of the corresponding
differential equation. We further build a Lax pair representing the resulting
quantum curve and thus present it as a point in an associated space of
meromorphic connections on the Riemann sphere, a first step towards
isomonodromic deformations. We finally propose two examples: the derivation of
a 2-parameter family of formal trans-series solutions to Painlev\'e 2 equation
and the quantization of a degree three spectral curve with pole only at
infinity.

shadows of hairy Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes obtained
through gravitational decoupling. In the context of hairy Schwarzschild black
holes, $l$ either has no effect or consistently enlarges the photon sphere
radius. Notably, even when it violates the strong energy condition, it can
decrease the radius. For Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, an additional matter
field consistently expands the photon sphere radius, potentially reaching $3M$,
akin to the pure Schwarzschild case. Remarkably, we demonstrate that black
holes can exist even when overcharged ($Q^2 > M^2$), casting shadows. Specific
intensity calculations reveal $l$ consistently reduces it in both scenarios.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pressureless plasma, finding $l$
exerts a stronger influence on visible size than plasma. These results can help
in our understanding of theoretical models of black hole shadows and can be
tested by comparison with the images obtained by EHT collaboration.

in the Einstein frame. We found the global qualitative behavior of the metric
and the scalaron field for all static solutions satisfying the conditions of
asymptotic flatness. These solutions are proved to be regular everywhere except
for a naked singularity at the center; they are uniquely determined by the
total mass $\mathfrak{M}$ and the ``scalar charge'' $Q$ characterizing the
strength of the scalaron field at spatial infinity. The case $Q=0$ yields the
Schwarzschild solution, but an arbitrarily small $Q\ne 0$ leads to the
appearance of a central naked singularity having a significant effect on the
neighboring region, even though the space-time metric in the outer region is
practically insensitive to the scalaron field. Approximation procedures are
developed to derive asymptotic relations near the naked singularity and at
spatial infinity, and the leading terms of the solutions are presented. We
investigate the linear stability of the static solutions with respect to radial
perturbations and numerically estimate the range of parameters corresponding to
stable/unstable configurations.

                                        <span>  We investigate possible configurations for vacuum multi-black holes that
maintain static equilibrium in expanding bubbles. Our analysis assumes a
five-dimensional Weyl metric to describe the spacetime, facilitating the
derivation of solutions based on the provided rod structure. We consider a
spacetime having expanding bubbles caused by one or two acceleration horizons,
and show that various configurations such as two bubbles, four bubbles devoid
of horizons, a black saturn, a black di-ring, a bicycling black ring
(orthogonal black di-ring), and a five-dimensional black hole binary can
achieve equilibrium within expanding bubbles. Specifically, we demonstrate that
equilibrium requires two acceleration horizons on both sides for the bicycling
ring and the five-dimensional black hole binary. However, only one acceleration
horizon is necessary for achieving equilibrium in the case of the black saturn
and the black di-ring.

                                        <span>  There has been strong interest in the possibility that in the quantum-gravity
realm momentum space might be curved, mainly focusing, especially for what
concerns phenomenological implications, on the case of a de Sitter momentum
space. We here take as starting point the known fact that quantum gravity
coupled to matter in $2+1$ spacetime dimensions gives rise to an effective
picture characterized by a momentum space with anti-de Sitter geometry, and we
point out some key properties of $2+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum
space. We observe that it is impossible to implement all of these properties in
theories with a $3+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum space, and we then
investigate, with the aim of providing guidance to the relevant phenomenology
focusing on possible modified laws of conservation of momenta, the implications
of giving up, in the $3+1$-dimensional case, some of the properties of the
$2+1$-dimensional case.

Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential
divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal
submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear
combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal
submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic
$Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing
results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a
decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over
compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in
dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact
even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.

                                        <span>  The most natural first-order PDE's to be imposed on a Cayley 4-form in eight
dimensions is the condition that it is closed. As is known, this implies
integrability of the Spin(7) structure defined by the Cayley form, as well as
Ricci-flatness of the associated metric. We address the question as to what the
most natural second-order in derivatives set of conditions is. We start by
constructing the most general diffeomorphism invariant second order in
derivatives Lagrangian that is quadratic in the perturbations of the Cayley
form. We find that there is a one-parameter family of such Lagrangians. We then
describe a non-linear completion of the linear story. To this end, we
parametrise the intrinsic torsion of a Spin(7) structure by a 3-form, and show
that this 3-form is completely determined by the exterior derivative of the
Cayley form. We construct an action functional, which depends on the Cayley
4-form and and auxiliary 3-form as independent variables. There is a unique
functional whose Euler-Lagrange equation for the auxiliary 3-form states that
it is equal to the torsion 3-form. There is, however, a more general
one-parameter family of functionals that can be constructed, and we show how
the linearisation of these functionals reproduces the linear story. For any
member of our family of theories, the Euler-Lagrange equations are written only
using the operator of exterior differentiation of forms, and do not require the
knowledge of the metric-compatible Levi-Civita connection. Geometrically, there
is a preferred member in the family of Lagrangians, and we propose that its
Euler-Lagrange equations are the most natural second-order equations to be
satisfied by Cayley forms. Our construction also leads to a natural geometric
flow in the space of Cayley forms, defined as the gradient flow of our action
functional.

the Bousso bound) in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant gravitational theories.
We focus on theories for which the higher derivative terms are considered as
small corrections in the Lagrangian to Einstein's two-derivative theory of
general relativity (GR). Even if the higher derivative corrections are treated
perturbatively, we provide instances of specific configurations for which they
can potentially violate the Bousso bound. To tackle this obstruction, we
propose a modification in the Bousso bound that incorporates the offending
contributions from the higher derivative corrections. Our proposed
modifications are equivalent to replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking area term by
Wald's definition (with dynamical corrections as suggested by Wall) for the
black hole entropy. Hence, the modifications are physically well motivated by
results from the laws of black hole mechanics in higher derivative theories.

arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the
classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton
emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on
the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic
quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum
Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in
the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained
for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At
the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to
the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires
non-minimal couplings. In $D>4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems
implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different
topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on
the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress
quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover
the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third
and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with
the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal
coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of
scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum
solutions only in $D=4$.

                                        <span>  In this work, we explore new constraints on phantom scalar field cosmologies
with a scalar field employing early times catalogues related to CMB
measurements, along with the local standard observables, like Supernovae Type
Ia (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements (Cosmic Clocks), and Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations (BAO) baselines. In particular, we studied a tracker phantom field
with hyperbolic polar coordinates that have been proposed in the literature.
The main goal is to obtain precise cosmological constraints for $H_0$ and
$\sigma_8$, in comparison to other constructions that present tension in early
cosmological parameters. Our results show that phantom scalar field cosmologies
have a reduced statistical tension on $H_0$ that it is less than 3$\sigma$
using model-independent CMB catalogues as SPT-3G+WMAP9 and ACTPol DR-4+WMAP9
baselines. This suggests these models using a different phantom potential might
address the Hubble constant problem and reduce the systematics involved.

                                        <span>  The interaction of a gravitational wave (GW) with an elastic body is usually
described in terms of a GW "force" driving the oscillations of the body's
normal modes. However, this description is only possible for GW frequencies for
which the response of the elastic body is dominated by a few normal modes. At
higher frequencies the normal modes blend into a quasi-continuum and a
field-theoretical description, as pioneered by Dyson already in 1969, becomes
necessary. However, since the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ is an
intrinsically relativistic object, a consistent coupling to GWs can only be
obtained within a relativistic (and, in fact generally covariant) theory of
elasticity. We develop such a formalism using the methods of modern effective
field theories, and we use it to provide a derivation of the interaction of
elastic bodies with GWs valid also in the high-frequency regime, providing a
first-principle derivation of Dyson's result (and partially correcting it). We
also stress that the field-theoretical results are obtained working in the TT
frame, while the description in terms of a force driving the normal modes is
only valid in the proper detector frame. We show how to transform the results
between the two frames. Beside an intrinsic conceptual interest, these results
are relevant to the computation of the sensitivity of the recently proposed
Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna.

                                        <span>  Like light, gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive
astrophysical objects. For galaxy and galaxy-cluster lenses, one expects to see
strong lensing -- forecasted to become observable in the coming years -- where
the original wave is split into multiple copies with the same frequency
evolution but different overall arrival times, phases, amplitudes, and signal
strengths. Some of these images can be below the detection threshold and
require targeted search methods, based on tailor-made template banks. These
searches can be made more sensitive by using our knowledge of the typical
distribution and morphology of lenses to predict the time delay, magnification,
and image-type ordering of the lensed images. Here, we show that when a subset
of the images is super-threshold, they can be used to construct a more
constrained prediction of the arrival time of the remaining signals, enhancing
our ability to identify lensing candidate signals. Our suggested method
effectively reduces the list of triggers requiring follow-up and generally
re-ranks the genuine counterpart higher in the lensing candidate list.
Therefore, in the future, if one observes two or three lensed images, the
information they provide can be used to identify their sub-threshold
counterparts, thus allowing identification of additional lensed images. Finding
such images would also strengthen our evidence for the event being lensed.

alternative approach to address the dark matter issue on the galactic scale.
Metric formalism of $f(R)$ theory is considered in this study. A mathematical
transformation tool called conformal transformation which transforms the action
from Jordan to Einstein frame is employed to simplify the fourth-order modified
field equation and to describe the extra degree of freedom $f_R$ by using a
minimally coupled scalar field (scalaron) showing the chameleonic character.
Then, we examine the viability of a newly introduced $f(R)$ gravity model on
behalf of the chameleonic behavior of the scalaron. The model analyzes this
behavior of the scalaron successfully with the singularity correction. Further,
we consider a test particle (star) in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime
to investigate the importance of the scalaron in galactic dynamics. In the
non-relativistic limit, the rotational velocity equation for the particle with
scalaron contribution is derived. This contribution is found to be model
dependent. We generate the rotation curves using the velocity equation and fit
the predicted curves to observational data of a set of thirty seven sample
galaxies of different categories. The curves are fitted based on two fitting
parameters $M_0$ and $r_c$. The fitting shows good agreement of the prediction
with the observed data.

for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion
charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field
flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only
in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity
equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of
on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends
itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d
super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric
super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.

constant as the positive pressure of the system and volume as its conjugate
variable, we analyse the thermodynamics of our black holes in the extended
phase space. Owing to the background clouds of strings parameter ($a$) and the
parameter endowed with PFDM ($\beta$), we analyse the Hawking temperature,
entropy and specific heat. We also investigate the relationship between the
photon sphere radius and the phase transition for the Letelier AdS black holes
immersed in PFDM. Through the analysis, we find with a particular condition,
there are non-monotonic behaviours between the photon sphere radius, the impact
parameter, the PFDM parameter, temperature, and pressure. We can regard both
the changes of photon sphere radius and impact parameter before and after phase
transition as the order parameter; their critical exponents near the critical
point are equal to the same value 1/2, just like ordinary thermal systems.
These indicate that a universal relation of gravity may exist near the critical
point for a black hole thermodynamic system.

                                        <span>  This paper describes the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field
across all four regions in the Rindler coordinates in the Lorentz covariant
gauge. In the four regions (future, past, left and right Rindler-wedges) in the
Rindler coordinates, defining the gauge-fixed Lagrangian in the Lorentz
covariant gauge, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field, the $B$-field and
ghost fields. Since the U(1) gauge and $B$-fields are decoupled from the ghost
fields by the property of the U(1) gauge theory, the U(1) gauge field and the
$B$-field are examined in this study.
  Then, by solving the equations of motion obtained from the gauge-fixed
Lagrangian, the solutions of each mode of the U(1) gauge field and the
$B$-field can be obtained. Following this, with the Klein-Gordon inner-product
defined in the Rindler coordinates, the normalization constants of each of
those mode-solutions are determined.
  Subsequently, formulating the canonical commutation relations of the U(1)
gauge field and its canonical conjugate momentum, the commutation relations of
the coefficient of each mode-solution in each direction of the U(1) gauge field
in each region of the Rindler coordinates are obtained. From these, it can be
seen that those coefficients have physical meaning as creation/annihilation
operators. The polarization vectors in each region of the Rindler coordinates
are also given in this study.
  From these, it is shown that the Minkowski ground state can be given as the
outer-product of the quantum states multiplied by the creation operators of the
U(1) gauge field in the left and right Rindler-wedge states.
  Then, obtaining the density matrix of the U(1) gauge theory in the right
Rindler-wedge from that, it is shown that the U(1) gauge field in the constant
accelerated system feels the Unruh temperature as well.

matter in linear massive gravity with or without the Fierz-Pauli (FP) tuning.
Adopting a polytropic equation of state, we construct master differential
equations for the stellar profile function, which is fourth order in the FP
theory or sixth order in generic non-FP theories, where the difference in the
differential order reflects the presence of a ghost spin-0 graviton in the
latter. In both cases, even when the spin-0 ghost is present, we find exact
solutions with finite radius for the polytropic indices n = 0 and 1. Analyzing
the dependences of the stellar radius, mass, and Yukawa charge on the graviton
masses, we observe that a discontinuous behavior arises in the massless limit
of the FP theory similarly to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity, while
it is absent in non-FP theories. We discuss rough observational constraints on
the graviton masses.

$80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with
cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including
scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing
the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory
including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$
dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of
equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and
discussed.

                                        <span>  Precession in Binary Black Holes (BBH) is caused by the failure of the Black
Hole spins to be aligned and its study can open up new perspectives in
gravitational waves (GW) astronomy, providing, among other advancements, a
precise measure of distance and an accurate characterization of the BBH spins.
However, detecting precessing signals is a highly non-trivial task, as standard
matched filtering pipelines for GW searches are built on many assumptions that
do not hold in the precessing case. This work details the upgrades made to the
GstLAL pipeline to facilitate the search for precessing BBH signals. The
implemented changes in the search statistics and in the signal consistency test
are then described in detail. The performance of the upgraded pipeline is
evaluated through two extensive searches of precessing signals, targeting two
different regions in the mass space, and the consistency of the results is
examined. Additionally, the benefits of the upgrades are assessed by comparing
the sensitive volume of the precessing searches with two corresponding
traditional aligned-spin searches. While no significant sensitivity improvement
is observed for precessing binaries with mass ratio $q\lesssim 6$, a volume
increase of up to 100\% is attainable for heavily asymmetric systems with
largely misaligned spins. This work paves the way for a large-scale search of
precessing signals, possibly leading to an exciting future detection.

In $osp(2|1)$ BF formulation, we discuss the asymptotic AdS condition. We
employ the Iwasawa-like decomposition of $OSp(2|1)$ group element to derive the

gravitational waves emitted by generic binary black hole (BBH) systems. The
test generalizes the time domain $\xi^2$ signal-consistency test currently
utilized by the GstLAL pipeline, which is restricted to aligned-spin circular
orbits and does not account for higher-order modes (HMs). After addressing the
mathematical details of the new test, we quantify its advantages in the context
of searching for precessing BBHs and/or BBHs with HM content. Our results
reveal that for precessing signals, the new test has the potential to diminish
$\xi^2$ by up to two orders of magnitude when compared to the standard test.
However, in the case of signals with HM content, only a modest enhancement is
observed. Recognizing the computational burden associated with the new test, we
also derive an approximated signal-consistency test. This approximation
maintains the same computational cost as the standard test while sacrificing
only a few percent of accuracy in the low SNR regime. The approximated test can
be easily implemented in any matched filtering pipeline aimed at searching for
BBH signals with strong precession content.

                                        <span>  The Rotational Doppler Effect (RDE) involves both the orbital angular
momentum of electromagnetic radiation as well as its helicity. The RDE
phenomena associated with photon helicity go beyond the standard theory of
relativity. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the theoretical basis of
the helicity-dependent RDE in terms of the general phenomenon of spin-rotation
coupling. The physical implications of this coupling are briefly pointed out
and the nonlocal theory of rotating observers is described. For an observer
rotating uniformly about the direction of incidence of a plane wave of definite
helicity, the nonlocally measured amplitude of the wave is larger (smaller) if
the observer rotates in the same (opposite) sense as the electromagnetic field.
The implications of the nonlocal helicity dependence of the measured amplitude
of the radiation are briefly discussed.

                                        <span>  It is generally believed that tidal deformations of a black hole in an
external field, as measured using its gravitational field multipoles, vanish.
However, this does not mean that the black hole horizon is not deformed. Here
we shall discuss the deformations of a black hole horizon in the presence of an
external field using a characteristic initial value formulation. Unlike
existing methods, the starting point here is the black hole horizon itself. The
effect of, say, a binary companion responsible for the tidal deformation is
encoded in the geometry of the spacetime in the vicinity of the horizon. The
near horizon spacetime geometry, i.e. the metric, spin coefficients, and
curvature components, are all obtained by integrating the Einstein field
equations outwards starting from the horizon. This method yields a
reformulation of black hole perturbation theory in a neighborhood of the
horizon. By specializing the horizon geometry to be a perturbation of Kerr,
this method can be used to calculate the metric for a tidally deformed Kerr
black hole with arbitrary spin. As a first application, we apply this
formulation here to a slowly spinning black hole and explicitly construct the
spacetime metric in a neighborhood of the horizon. We propose natural
definitions of the electric and magnetic surficial Love numbers based on the
Weyl tensor component $\Psi_2$. From our solution, we calculate the tidal
perturbations of the black hole, and we extract both the field Love numbers and
the surficial Love numbers which quantify the deformations of the horizon.

kpc can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger
precursors. In this study, we use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to
investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the
properties of AGNs ($L_{bol} > 10^{43} \rm erg/s$) and their neighboring SMBHs
(any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at $z \leq 2$. This is our underlying
population. Subsequently, we applied the luminosity threshold of $L_{bol} >
10^{43} erg/s$ to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple
AGNs in our simulation. We examined the properties and statistics of dual AGNs
in comparison to single AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number
of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. All dual AGNs in
our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared with the single AGN
population, duals are characterized by a lower black hole to halo mass ratio.
We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass,
stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas mass, are generally consistent
with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending towards the higher end of their
respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of
evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems,
slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.

Euclidean path integral, with asymptotically $AdS$ boundary conditions. In the
semiclassical limit, it describes a Euclidean (half)-wormhole geometry,
exhibiting a local maximum of the scale factor at the surface of reflection
symmetry, giving rise to an expanding universe upon analytic continuation to
Lorentzian signature. We find that these Euclidean wormholes set natural
initial conditions for inflation and that the semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt
wavefunction can favor a long lasting inflationary epoch, resolving a well
known issue of the no-boundary proposal. Due to the asymptotic $AdS$ conditions
in the Euclidean past they raise the possibility of describing the physics of
inflating cosmologies and their perturbations within the context of holography.

                                        <span>  Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a
strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are
produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced
on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such
primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the
scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The
recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the
pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing
the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are
assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the
mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to
explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In
this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power
spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary
GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of
radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the
conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs
produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the
scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper
equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a
stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs
produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.

spinning mass differ in the time required to complete the same orbit. The
difference in these two values for the orbital period is generally referred to
as the gravito-magnetic (GM) clock effect. It has been proposed to measure the
GM clock effect using atomic clocks carried by satellites in prograde and
retrograde orbits around the Earth. The precision and stability required for
satellites to accurately perform this measurement remains a challenge for
current instrumentation. One of the most accurate clocks in the Universe is a
millisecond pulsar, which emits periodic radio pulses with high stability.
Timing of the pulsed signals from millisecond pulsars has proven to be very
successful in testing predictions of general relativity and the GM clock effect
is potentially measurable in binary systems. In this work we derive the generic
GM clock effect by considering a slowly-spinning binary system on an elliptical
orbit, with both arbitrary mass ratio and arbitrary spin orientations. The
spin-orbit interaction introduces a perturbation to the orbit, causing the
orbital plane to precess and nutate. We identify several different
contributions to the clock effects: the choice of spin supplementary condition
and the observer-dependent definition of a full revolution and
"nearly-identical" orbits. We discuss the impact of these subtle definitions on
the formula for GM clock effects and show that most of the existing formulae in
the literature can be recovered under appropriate assumptions.

                                        <span>  In this work, we investigate the impact of tidal torques and mass transfer on
the population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that will be observed with LISA.
Starting from a distribution of DWDs at formation predicted by numerical
simulations, we use a semi-analytical model to evolve DWDs under different
hypotheses for the efficiency of tidal coupling and the birth spins of white
dwarfs. We then estimate the stochastic foreground and the population of
resolvable binaries for LISA in each scenario. Our predicted DWD binary
distribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only
gravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we
predict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral
after the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences
in the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In
that case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in
the GW-only scenario. If instead white dwarfs spin rapidly and tidal coupling
is weak, then we find no excess around a few mHz, and the confusion noise due
to DWDs is very small. In that scenario, we also predict a subpopulation of
outspiralling binaries below 0.1 mHz. Using the Fisher matrix approximation, we
estimate the uncertainty on the GW-frequency derivative of resolvable systems.
We estimate that, even for non-accreting systems, the mismodelling error due to
neglect of effects other than GWs is larger than the statistical uncertainty,
and thus this neglect would lead to biased estimates for mass and distance. Our
results highlight the need for flexible tools in LISA data analysis. Because
our semi-analytical model hinges upon a simplistic approach to determining the
stability of mass accretion it will be important to deepen our comprehension of
stability in mass-transferring DWD binaries.

                                        <span>  In most analytical studies of light ray propagation in curved spacetimes
around a gravitating object surrounded by a medium, it is assumed that the
medium is a cold nonmagnetized plasma. The distinctive feature of this
environment is that the equations of motion of the rays are independent of the
plasma velocity, which, however, is not the case in other media. In this paper,
we consider the deflection of light rays propagating near a spherically
symmetric gravitating object in a moving dispersive medium given by a general
refractive index. The deflection is studied when the motion of the medium is
defined either as a radially falling onto a gravitating object (e.g., black
hole), or rotating in the equatorial plane. For both cases the deflection
angles are obtained. These examples demonstrate that fully analytic expressions
can be obtained if the Hamiltonian for the rays takes a rather general form as
a polynomial in a given momentum component. The general expressions are further
applied to three specific choices of refractive indices and these cases are
compared. Furthermore, the light rays propagating around a gravitating object
surrounded by a generally moving medium are further studied as a small
perturbation of the cold plasma model. The deflection angle formula is hence
expressed as a sum of zeroth and first order components, where the zeroth order
term corresponds to the known cold plasma case and the first order correction
can be interpreted as caused by small difference in the refractive index
compared to the cold plasma. The results presented in this paper allow to
describe the effects caused by the motion of a medium and thus go beyond cold
nonmagnetized plasma model.

                                        <span>  Detection confidence of the source-agnostic gravitational-wave burst search
pipeline BayesWave is quantified by the log signal-versus-glitch Bayes factor,
$\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$. A recent study shows that
$\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$ increases with the number of
detectors. However, the increasing frequency of non-Gaussian noise transients
(glitches) in expanded detector networks is not accounted for in the study.
Glitches can mimic or mask burst signals resulting in false alarm detections,
consequently reducing detection confidence. This paper an empirical study on
the impact of false alarms on the overall performance of BayesWave, with
expanded detector networks. The noise background of BayesWave for the
Hanford-Livingston (HL, two-detector) and Hanford-Livingston-Virgo (HLV,
three-detector) networks are measured using a set of non-astrophysical
background triggers from the first half of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's
Third Observing Run (O3a). Efficiency curves are constructed by combining
$\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$ of simulated binary black hole
signals with the background measurements, to characterize BayesWave's detection
efficiency as a function of the per-trigger false alarm probability. The HL and
HLV network efficiency curves are shown to be similar. A separate analysis
finds that detection significance of O3 gravitational-wave candidates as
measured by BayesWave are also comparable for the HL and HLV networks.
Consistent results from the two independent analyses suggests that the overall
burst detection performance of BayesWave does not improve with the addition of
Virgo at O3a sensitivity, because the increased false alarm probability offsets
the advantage of higher $\ln\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{G}}$.

for vacuum tensor perturbations at the level of the effective action, adopting
Hadamard regularization techniques to isolate short distance divergences and
gauge fixing via the Faddeev-Popov procedure. The subsequently derived
renormalized stress tensor can be related to more familiar forms reliant upon
an averaging prescription, such as the Isaacson or Misner-Thorne-Wheeler forms.
The latter, however, are premised on a prior scale separation (beyond which the
averaging is invoked) and therefore unsuited for the purposes of
renormalization. This can lead to potentially unphysical conclusions when taken
as a starting point for the computation of any observable that needs
regularization, such as the energy density associated to a stochastic
background. Any averaging prescription, if needed, should only be invoked at
the end of the renormalization procedure. The latter necessarily involves the
imposition of renormalization conditions via a physical measurement at some
fixed scale, which we retrace for primordial gravitational waves sourced from
vacuum fluctuations through direct or indirect observation.

distinct dark matter halo profiles to test the possibility of generalised
wormhole geometry within the galactic halo regions. The current study aims to
accomplish these goals by examining various dark matter profiles including
Universal Rotation Curves (URC), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model-I, and NFW
model-II inside two distinct $f(R, L_m)$ gravity models. According to the $f(R,
L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m^\alpha$ model, the DM halo density profiles produce
suitable shape functions that meet all the necessary requirements for
exhibiting the wormhole geometries with appropriate choice of free parameters.
In addition, to examine DM profiles under the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + (1 +
\lambda R)L_m$ model, we consider a specific shape function. Further, we
observed that the derived solution from both two models violates the null
energy constraints, confirming that the DM supports wormholes to maintain in
the galactic halo.

within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent
era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to
focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to
observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last
mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each
mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the
additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement
entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume
term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late
times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the
magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the
quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation.
Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting
fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during
inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an
observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would
interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after
inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.

                                        <span>  In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing
hydrodynamic formalisms, which in order to be causal and stable, (i) either
requires to promote the `non-fluid' variables as the new degrees of freedom
apart from the velocity and temperature, or (ii) needs to be in a general
hydrodynamic frame other than the ones given by Landau and Eckart. We have
rewritten the BDNK stress tensor (originally in the general frame) into the
Landau frame by redefining the fluid variables such as velocity ($u^{\mu}$) and
temperature ($T$) via a hydrodynamic frame transformation. This `fluid frame'
transformation includes shift variables $\delta u^{\mu}$ and $\delta T$, which
are small enough to be treated linearly but encompass all orders of gradient
corrections. The redefinition indicates that though the BDNK formalism has a
finite number of derivatives, in the Landau frame, it will either have an
infinite number of derivatives or one has to resum them by introducing new
`non-fluid' variables much like the MIS theory. The infinite derivative series
are summed in two different ways that lead to two different methods of
`integrating in' new `non-fluid' variables, showing the non-uniqueness of the
process of `integrating in' new variables. Finally, the dispersion relations
and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations
have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are
indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.

                                        <span>  It is well known that the Einstein-Hilbert action in two dimensions is
topological and yields an identically vanishing Einstein tensor. Consequently
one is faced with difficulties when formulating a non-trivial gravity model. We
present a new, intrinsically two-dimensional, approach to this problem based on
the Einstein action. This yields a well defined variational approach which
results in new field equations that break diffeomorphism invariance. Our
proposed approach does not require the introduction of additional scalar
fields, nor the use of conformal transformations. However, we can show how
including conformal counter terms leads to equivalent results. In doing so, we
can provide an explanation for why previous approaches worked. Solutions to the
field equations are briefly discussed.

                                        <span>  Recently, the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported the
evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hertz
band. The spectrum of inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) is unknown, which
might exhibit different power law at different frequency-bands, thus if the PTA
signal is primordial, it will be significant to explore the underlying
implications of current PTA and CMB data on IGW. In this paper, we perform a
joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for a broken power-law spectrum of IGW
with the NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data. It is found that though the
bestfit spectral tilt of IGW at PTA band is $n^\text{PTA}_\text{T}
=2.42^{+0.32}_{-0.91}$, at CMB band the bestfit is $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T}
=0.55^{+0.37}_{-0.10}$ while a detectable amplitude of $r$ with
$n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} \simeq 0$ is still compatible. The implication of our
results for inflation is also discussed.

interacting with massless scalar fields under instantaneous interactions, to
construct a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine. By deriving the conditions
under which the thermodynamic cycle is closed we study the effects of motion on
the amount of work that can be extracted from the machine when the working
medium is moving at a constant relativistic velocity through the heat baths.
While there is a degrading effect with respect to speed in the hot bath, we
demonstrate that in the case of the cold bath, genuine enhancing effects are
sometimes present. For couplings the same order as the inverse frequency of the
detector and a specific value for the temporal separation between the two
instantaneous interactions--needed in order to be possible to cool the
detector--a non-monotonic dependence between speed and extracted work exists
raising the intriguing possibility of exploiting relativistic effects for the
enhancement of thermodynamic processes in tabletop experiments.

observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band.
This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of
Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA
Data Challenge 2a is focused on robust signal extraction from a blend of these
two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high
performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and
characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and
estimate the noise of the residual. We perform the pipeline in a time-evolving
weekly analysis starting with an observation time of 1 week until we reach a
full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole
binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument
noise with each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a
novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple
massive black hole binaries. Additionally, we demonstrate a massive black hole
binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher
harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.

critical points for the dyonic AdS black holes with quasitopological
electromagnetism in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet background. To this end, we find
a small/large black hole phase transition in all dimensions of space-time, the
existence of a conventional critical point implies a total topological charge
of $Q_t=-1$. The coupling constant $\alpha$ gives rise to a more intricate
phase structure, with the emergence of a triple points requires $\alpha\geq0.5$
and $d=6$. Interestingly, the condition for the occurrence of
small/intermediate/large phase transition is that the coupling constant a takes
a special value ($\alpha=0.5$), the two conventional critical points
$CP_{1},CP_{2}$ of the black hole are physical critical point, and the novel
critical point $CP_{3}$ that lacks the capability to minimize the Gibbs free
energy. The critical points $CP_{1}$ and $CP_{2}$ are observed to occur at the
maximum extreme points of temperature in the isobaric curve, while the critical
point $CP_{3}$, emerges at the minimum extreme points of temperature.
Furthermore, the number of phases at the novel critical point exhibits an
upward trend, followed by a subsequent decline at the conventional critical
points. With the increase of the coupling constant ($\alpha = 1$), although the
system has three critical points, only the conventional $CP_{1}$ is a
(physical) critical point, and the conventional $CP_{2}$ serves as the phase
annihilation point. This means that the coupling constant $\alpha$ has a
non-negligible effect on the phase structure.

                                        <span>  The detection of low-frequency gravitational waves on Earth requires the
reduction of displacement noise, which dominates the low-frequency band. One
method to cancel test mass displacement noise is a neutron
displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI). This paper proposes a new neutron
DFI configuration, a Sagnac-type neutron DFI, which uses a Sagnac
interferometer in place of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We demonstrate that
a sensitivity of the Sagnac-type neutron DFI is higher than that of a
conventional neutron DFI with the same interferometer scale. This configuration
is particularly significant for neutron DFIs with limited space for
construction and limited flux from available neutron sources.

                                        <span>  In a seminal paper, Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond classified kinematical algebras,
a class of Lie algebras encoding the symmetries of spacetime. Homogeneous
spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated to these possible
kinematics can be partitioned into four families -- riemannian, lorentzian,
galilean and carrollian -- based on the type of invariant metric structure they
admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics -- defined as
extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal -- as well as their
associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along
the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient
Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique -- trivial and
torsion-free -- higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are
constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein
pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its
curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically
allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation
between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian
Klein pairs.

gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in
perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de
Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric
series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees
within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a
Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative
computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges
to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.

                                        <span>  We present a numerical calculation of the expectation value of the quantum
angular-momentum current flux density for a scalar field in the Unruh state
near the inner horizon of a Kerr-de Sitter black hole. Our results indicate
that this flux diverges as $V_-^{-1}$ in a suitable Kruskal coordinate such
that $V_-=0$ at the inner horizon. Depending on the parameter values of the
scalar field and black hole that we consider, and depending on the polar angle
(latitude), this flux can have different signs. In the near extremal cases
considered, the angle average of the expectation value of the quantum angular
momentum current flux is of the opposite sign as the angular momentum of the
background itself, suggesting that, in the cases considered, quantum effects
tend to decrease the total angular momentum of the spheres away from the
extremal value. We also numerically calculate the energy flux component, which
provides the leading order divergence of the quantum stress energy tensor,
dominant over the classical stress energy tensor, at the inner horizon. Taking
our expectation value of the quantum stress tensor as the source in the
semiclassical Einstein equation, our analysis suggests that the spheres
approaching the inner horizon can undergo an infinite twisting due to quantum
effects along latitudes separating regions of infinite expansion and
contraction.

quantum paradigm has challenged the scientific community for a century today. A
mechanism of gravitational self-interaction, governed by the so-called
Schroedinger-Newton equation, is among the proposals that aim to shed some
light on it. Despite all efforts, this mechanism has been proven difficult to
probe. Here, we consider a simple Stern-Gerlach-like experiment to try it out.
The Schroedinger-Newton equation can be analytically solved under certain
proper conditions, and a dephasing effect induced by the gravitational
self-interacting potential can be calculated.

                                        <span>  Quasinormal modes and frequencies are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a
non-Hermitian differential operator. They hold crucial significance in the
physics of black holes. The analysis of quasinormal modes of black holes in
asymptotically Anti-de Sitter geometries plays also a key role in the study of
strongly coupled quantum many-body systems via gauge/gravity duality. In
contrast to normal Sturm-Liouville operators, the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian
(and non-normal) operators generally exhibit instability under small
perturbations. This research focuses on the stability analysis of quasinormal
frequencies pertaining to asymptotically planar AdS black holes, employing
pseudospectrum analysis. Specifically, we concentrate on the pseudospectra of
scalar and transverse gauge fields, shedding light on their relevance within
the framework of gauge/gravity duality.

                                        <span>  The measurement of eccentricity would provide strong constraints on the
formation channel of stellar-mass binary black holes. However, current
ground-based gravitational wave detectors will, in most cases, not be able to
measure eccentricity due to orbital circularization. Space-based observatories,
in contrast, can determine binary eccentricity at 0.01Hz to
$e_{0.01}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}) $. Directly observing stellar-mass binary
black holes with space-based observatories remains a challenging problem.
However, observing such systems with ground-based detectors allows the
possibility to identify the same signal in archival data from space-based
observatories in the years previous. Since ground-based detectors provide
little constraints on eccentricity, including eccentricity in the archival
search will increase the required number of filter waveforms for the archival
search by 5 orders of magnitudes [from $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\sim
\mathcal{O}(10^8)$], and will correspondingly need $ \sim8\times10^5 $ core
hours (and $ \sim 10^5$ GB of memory), even for a mild upper limit on
eccentricity of $0.1$. In this work, we have constructed the first template
bank for an archival search of space-based gravitational wave detectors,
including eccentricity. We have demonstrated that even though the inclusion of
eccentricity brings extra computational burden, an archival search including
eccentricity will be feasible in the time frame of planned space-based
observatories, and will provide strong constraints on the eccentricities of
stellar-mass binary black holes.

$James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two
aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole
binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members
of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently
-- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for
concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav
Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic
gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating
the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries
at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.

refinement algorithm in our numerical relativity code GR-Athena++ in the
context of binary black hole merger simulations. We compare three different
strategies: the "box-in-box" approach, the "sphere-in-sphere" approach and a
local criterion for refinement based on the estimation of truncation error of
the finite difference scheme. We extract and compare gravitational waveforms
using the three different mesh refinement methods and compare their accuracy
against a calibration waveform and demonstrate that the sphere-in-sphere
approach provides the best strategy overall when considering computational cost
and the waveform accuracy. Ultimately, we demonstrate the capability of each
mesh refinement method in accurately simulating gravitational waves from binary
black hole systems -- a crucial aspect for their application in next-generation
detectors. We quantify the mismatch achievable with the different strategies by
extrapolating the gravitational wave mismatch to higher resolution.

tensions simultaneously. Such a modified cosmological scenario is obtained by
the application of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, but using the
non-additive Tsallis entropy, instead of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking one.
Hence, one obtains modified Friedmann equations, with extra terms that depend
on the new Tsallis exponent $\delta$ that quantifies the departure from
standard entropy. We show that for particular $\delta$ choices we can obtain a
phantom effective dark energy, which is known to be one of the sufficient
mechanisms that can alleviate $H_0$ tension. Additionally, for the same
parameter choice we obtain an increased friction term and an effective Newton's
constant smaller than the usual one, and thus the $\sigma_8$ tension is also
solved. These features act as a significant advantage of Tsallis modified
cosmology.

escaping. For any given electromagnetic source around the black hole, a distant
observer would thus observe two infinite sequences of images on either side of
the black hole. These images are generated by light rays performing an
increasing numbers of loops. The strong deflection limit provides a simple
analytic formalism to describe such higher order images for spherically
symmetric metrics, while for axially symmetric black holes one typically
resorts to numerical approaches. Here we present the leading order perturbation
to higher order images when the black hole spin is turned on. We show that the
images slide around the black hole shadow as an effect of space-time dragging.
We derive analytical formulae for their shifts and the perturbation of their
time delays. We also discuss how such simple analytical formulae for images by
Kerr black holes can be of great help in many applications.

                                        <span>  An efficient way to study the QCD phase diagram at small finite density is to
extrapolate thermodynamical observables from imaginary chemical potential. The
phase diagram features a crossover line starting from the transition
temperature already determined at zero chemical potential. In this work we
focus on the Taylor expansion of this line up to $\mu^4$ contributions. We
present the continuum extrapolation of the crossover temperature based on
different observables at several lattice spacings.

$J^P=\frac{5}{2}^{\pm}$ with molecular, diquark-diquark-antiquark, and

different within the same model according to same quantum numbers and

taken into account with the same angular momentum. The magnetic moments encode
valuable information about inner structures. We believe that our results may be

                                        <span>  We present here the first numerical test of symplectic quantization, a new
approach to quantum field theory. Symplectic quantization is characterized by
the possibility to sample quantum fluctuations of relativistic fields by means
of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations, the latter
evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$. In the present
work we study numerically the symplectic quantization dynamics for a real
scalar field in 1+1 space-time dimensions and with $\lambda \phi^4$ non-linear
interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the Fourier spectrum of the
two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively
well the shape of the Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the
expectation over quantum fluctuations is computed as a dynamical average along
the trajectories parametrized by the intrinsic time $\tau$. As a numerical
strategy to study quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Lorentzian
space-time, we believe that symplectic quantization will be of key importance
for the study of non-equilibrium relaxational dynamics in quantum field theory
and the phenomenology of metastable bound states with very short life-time,
something usually not accessible by numerical methods based on Euclidean field
theory.

order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with
the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently
(arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide
analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations,
together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable
perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared
suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor
with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice
investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in
the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop
contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point
correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall
constant factor.

anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance,
the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the
dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge
fields. The anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity with the dressing factor shows
that, when the symmetry operator sweep out a 't~Hooft loop, the loop acquires a
surface operator of the $U(1)$ field strength with a correction of a higher cup
product. This result appears consistent with the phenomenon observed in the
continuum theory. A similar analysis for the axion string operator shows that
it is not affected by the symmetry operator.

$R(D^*)$ and $\vert V_{ub} \vert/\vert V_{cb} \vert$ based on the new data on
semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays by the Belle and Belle-II

either the Dispersive Matrix (DM) method of Refs. [1-6] or the more standard
Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) [7] approach to the most recent values of the form
factors determined in lattice QCD. Using all the available lattice results for
the form factors from the DM method we get the theoretical value $R^{\rm
th}(D^*) = 0.262 \pm 0.009$ and we extract from a bin-per-bin analysis of the
experimental data the value $\vert V_{cb} \vert = (39.92 \pm 0.64)

experimental world average $R^{\rm exp}(D^*) = 0.284 \pm 0.012$ [8]} at the
$\simeq 1.5\,\sigma$ level. Our value for $\vert V_{cb} \vert$ is compatible
with the latest inclusive determinations $\vert V_{cb} \vert^{\rm incl} =
(41.97 \pm 0.48) \cdot 10^{-3}$ [9] and $\vert V_{cb} \vert^{\rm incl} =
(41.69\pm 0.63) \cdot 10^{-3}$ [10] within $\simeq 2.6$ and $\simeq 2.0$
standard deviations, respectively. From a reappraisal of the calculations of
$\vert V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert$, we also obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert /
\vert V_{cb} \vert = 0.087\pm 0.009$ in good agreement with the result $\vert
V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert = 0.0844\pm 0.0056$ from the latest FLAG

                                        <span>  Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic
degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation
using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more
scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for
such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the
quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the
Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one
spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of
measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm
to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we
present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states
using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework.
We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian
based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the
corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with
system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the
gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods
for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied
to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost
resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant
implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical
instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to
improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this
might be achieved.

$D=2,3,4$ via the numerical bootstrap method. It combines the Makeenko-Migdal
loop equations, with a cut-off $L_{\mathrm{max}}$ on the maximal length of
loops, and positivity conditions on certain matrices of Wilson loops. Our
algorithm is inspired by the pioneering paper of P.Anderson and M.Kruczenski
but it is significantly more efficient, as it takes into account the symmetries
of the lattice theory and uses the relaxation procedure in line with our
previous work on matrix bootstrap. We thus obtain rigorous upper and lower
bounds on the plaquette average at various couplings and dimensions. For $D=4$,
the lower bound data appear to be close to the MC data in the strong coupling
phase and the upper bound data in the weak coupling phase reproduce well the
3-loop perturbation theory. Our results suggest that this bootstrap approach
can provide a tangible alternative to the, so far uncontested, Monte Carlo
approach.

an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom
on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one
approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of
freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called
``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in
earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same
universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate
the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient
for quantum simulations.

                                        <span>  According to the preceding studies, the lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with
a single scalar field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group has
a single confinement-Higgs phase where confinement and Higgs regions are
subregions of an analytically continued single phase and there are no
thermodynamic phase transitions, which is a well-known consequence of the
Osterwalder-Seiler-Fradkin-Shenker theorem. In this paper, we show that we can
define new types of gauge-invariant operators by combining the original
fundamental scalar field and the so-called color-direction field which is
obtained by change of field variables based on the gauge-covariant
decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi.
By performing the numerical simulations on the lattice without any gauge
fixing, we reproduce the conventional thermodynamic transition line in the weak
gauge coupling, and moreover we find a new transition line detected by the new
gauge-invariant operators which separates the confinement-Higgs phase into two
parts, confinement phase and the Higgs phase, in the strong gauge coupling. All
results are obtained in the gauge-independent way, since no gauge fixing has
been imposed in the numerical simulations. Moreover, we discuss a physical
interpretation for the new transition from the viewpoint of the realization of
a global symmetry.

                                        <span>  Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical
point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum
field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a
new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond
the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase
transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance,
in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP
between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as
first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible
with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is
exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its
entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the
current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior
persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study
the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale
quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$
smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists
in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models
do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a
finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are
consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the
Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.

catalyst for the highly efficient degradation of antibiotics, but the
structure-activity relationship remains elusive. Herein, garland-like
MIL-101(Fe)/MoS2 nanosheets (MMS) with dual metal active sites (Fe and Mo) and
rich sulfur vacancies were fabricated to directly activate peroxymonosulfate
(PMS) for fast degradation of different organic pollutants (phenols, dyes and
drugs), even in real water bodies. The MMS exhibited extremely fast catalytic
rate constant of 0.289 min-1 in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX),
which was about 36 and 29 times that of single MoS2 (0.008 min-1) and
MIL-101(Fe) (0.01 min-1). Moreover, MMS with good stability and reusability
could reach 92% degradation of SMX after 5 cycles. Quenching experiments and
electron spin resonance (ESR) tests revealed that hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and
singlet oxygen (1O2) were the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SMX
degradation. The integration of experimental works, characterization techniques
and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unraveled that the formation
of sulfur vacancies in MMS catalyst could expose more Mo sites, improve the
charge density and boost the electron transfer, which was conducive to
accelerating the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle for enhancing the activation of PMS. Finally,
the C-N, N-O, S-N, C-O and C-S bonds of SMX were easily attacked by ROS to
generate the nontoxic intermediates in the MMS/PMS/SMX system. This study
offers a new approach to designing high-performance Fe-MoS2 catalysts for the
removal of organic pollutants.

a magneto-optical trap formed by the $6s^{2}~^1S_0-6s6p~^3P_1$ intercombination

determined to be $695~171~054~858.1(8.2)$~kHz against physical realization of
Coordinated Universal Time maintained by the National Metrology Institute of
Japan with a frequency comb. The $g$ factor of the transition to the $F=3/2$

heralding new paradigms in quantum communication, computation, and
cryptography. This paper introduces a quantum optimal control approach by
focusing on entanglement measures rather than targeting predefined maximally
entangled states. Leveraging the indirect Pontryagin Minimum Principle, we
formulate an optimal control problem centered on maximizing an enhanced lower
bound of the entanglement measure within a shortest timeframe in the presence
of input constraints. We derive optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's
Minimum Principle tailored for a matrix-valued dynamic control system and
tackle the resulting boundary value problem through a Physics-Informed Neural
Network, which is adept at handling differential matrix equations. The proposed
strategy not only refines the process of generating entangled states but also
introduces a method with increased sensitivity in detecting entangled states,
thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional concurrence estimation.

$-155.7\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~ -163.0\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~
-178.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1} $ and$~-211.1\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ at
$9.072~GHz~(WGH_{4,1,1})$ for the nuclear magnetic quantum number
$M_I=+\frac{3}{2},+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$,~and$-\frac{3}{2}$ respectively.
The anisotropy of the hyperfine structure reveals a characteristics of static
Jahn-Teller effect. The second-order-anisotropy-term, $\sim
(\frac{spin-orbit~coupling}{10D_q})^2$, is significant and can not be
disregarded, with the local strain dominating over the observed
Zeeman-anisotropy-energy difference. The Bohr electron magneton,
$\beta=9.23\times 10^{-24} JT^{-1}$, (within $-0.43\%$ so-called experimental
error) has been found using the measured spin-Hamiltonian parameters. Measured
nuclear dipolar hyperfine structure parameter
$P_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel}=12.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ shows that the mean
inverse third power of the electron distance from the nucleus is $\langle
r^{-3}_q\rangle\simeq 5.23$ a.u. for $Cu^{2+}$ ion in the substituted $Al^{3+}$
ion site assuming nuclear electric quadruple moment $Q=-0.211$ barn.

                                        <span>  The performance and accuracy of quantum electronics is substantially degraded
when the temperature of the electrons in the devices is too high. The electron
temperature can be reduced with appropriate thermal anchoring and by filtering
both the low frequency and radio frequency noise. Ultimately, for high
performance filters the electron temperature can approach the phonon
temperature (as measured by resistive thermometers) in a dilution refrigerator.
In this application note, the method for measuring the electron temperature in
a typical quantum electronics device using Coulomb blockade thermometry is
described. This technique is applied to find the readily achievable electron
temperature in the device when using the QFilter provided by QDevil. With our
thermometry measurements, using a single GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot in an
optimized experimental setup, we determined an electron temperature of 28 $\pm$
2 mK for a dilution refrigerator base temperature of 18 mK.

application in a variety of phenomena such as optical communication, optical
forces and sensing. However, the quantum behavior including the commutation
relations have been relatively less explored. Here, we derive the correct
commutation relation for the total angular momentum of light using both
relativistic and non-relativistic approaches. An important outcome of our work
is the proof that the widely-assumed quantum commutation relation for the total
observable angular momentum of light is fundamentally incorrect. Our work will
motivate experiments and leads to new insight on the quantum behavior of the
angular momentum of light.

reconciliation schemes are proposed, where both the authenticated classical
channel (ClC) and the quantum channel (QuC) for QKD are protected by separate
forward error correction (FEC) coding schemes. More explicitly, a new
codeword-based - rather than syndrome-based - QKD reconciliation scheme is
proposed, where Alice sends an FEC-protected codeword to Bob through a ClC,
while Bob sends a separate FEC protected codeword to Alice through a QuC. Upon
decoding the codeword received from the other side, the final key is obtained
by applying a simple modulo-2 operation to the local codeword and the decoded
remote codeword. As a result, first of all, the proposed codeword-based QKD
reconciliation system ensures protection of both the QuC and of the ClC.
Secondly, the proposed system has a similar complexity at both sides, where
both Alice and Bob have an FEC encoder and an FEC decoder. Thirdly, the
proposed system makes QKD reconciliation compatible with a wide range of FEC
schemes, including polar codes, CCs and irregular convolutional codes (IRCCs),
where a near-capacity performance can be achieved for both the QuC and for the
ClC.Our simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed regime, the
performance improvements of the QuC and of the ClC benefit each other, hence
leading to an improved secret key rate (SKR) that inches closer to both the
Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound and to the maximum achieveable
rate bound.

                                        <span>  Superconducting qubits are a promising platform for building fault-tolerant
quantum computers, with recent achievement showing the suppression of logical
error with increasing code size. However, leakage into non-computational
states, a common issue in practical quantum systems including superconducting
circuits, introduces correlated errors that undermine QEC scalability. Here, we
propose and demonstrate a leakage reduction scheme utilizing tunable couplers,
a widely adopted ingredient in large-scale superconducting quantum processors.
Leveraging the strong frequency tunability of the couplers and stray
interaction between the couplers and readout resonators, we eliminate state
leakage on the couplers, thus suppressing space-correlated errors caused by
population propagation among the couplers. Assisted by the couplers, we further
reduce leakage to higher qubit levels with high efficiency (98.1%) and low
error rate on the computational subspace (0.58%), suppressing time-correlated
errors during QEC cycles. The performance of our scheme demonstrates its
potential as an indispensable building block for scalable QEC with
superconducting qubits.

                                        <span>  As quantum computing devices become larger with respect to the number of
qubits, the realization of two-qubit interactions becomes more challenging,
necessitating innovative and scalable qubit routing solutions. In this work, we
introduce beSnake, a novel algorithm specifically designed to address the
intricate qubit routing challenges in scalable spin-qubit architectures. The
algorithm utilizes shuttle operations that physically move a qubit to an
adjacent, unoccupied quantum dot. Unlike traditional methods in superconducting
architectures that solely rely on SWAP operations, beSnake incorporates those
shuttle operations to optimize the execution time of the circuits and achieve
higher operational fidelity and quicker computation times of the routing task
itself. By employing a breadth-first search approach, beSnake effectively
manages the restrictions created by diverse topologies and positions of qubits.
It also dynamically tackles parallelized routing tasks with multiple qubits
that act as obstacles with the option to adjust the level of optimization. Our
simulations demonstrate beSnake's advantage over an existing routing solution
for random circuits and real quantum algorithms with up to $1,000$ qubits. It
shows on average an up to $80\%$ and $54\%$ improvement in gate overhead and
depth overhead, respectively, and up to $8.33$ times faster routing time.

                                        <span>  Quantum trajectory techniques have been used in the theory of open systems as
a starting point for numerical computations and to describe the monitoring of a
quantum system in continuous time. Here we extend this technique and use it to
develop a general approach to the dynamics of quantum/classical hybrid systems.
By using two coupled stochastic differential equations, we can describe a
classical component and a quantum one which have their own intrinsic dynamics
and which interact with each other. A mathematically rigorous construction is
given, under the restriction of having a Markovian joint dynamics and of
involving only bounded operators on the Hilbert space of the quantum component.
An important feature is that, if the interaction allows for a flow of
information from the quantum component to the classical one, necessarily the
dynamics is dissipative. We show also how this theory is connected to a
suitable hybrid dynamical semigroup, which reduces to a quantum dynamical
semigroup in the purely quantum case and includes Liouville and
Kolmogorov-Fokker-Plank equations in the purely classical case. Moreover, this
semigroup allows to compare the proposed stochastic dynamics with various other
proposals based on hybrid master equations. Some simple example are constructed
in order to show the variety of physical behaviours which can be described; in
particular, a model presenting hidden entanglement is introduced.

                                        <span>  Conventional approaches to quantum error correction for fault-tolerant
quantum computation are based on encoding a single logical qubit into many
physical qubits, resulting in asymptotically zero encoding rates and therefore
huge resource overheads. To overcome this issue, high-rate quantum codes, such
as quantum low-density parity-check codes, have been studied over the past
decade. However, such codes have complex structure, making it difficult to
perform logical gate operations in parallel without sacrificing their
advantage. Observing the simple structure and high rates of quantum
error-detecting codes, here we propose concatenated high-rate quantum
error-detecting codes as a new family of high-rate quantum codes. Their simple
structure allows for a geometrical interpretation using hypercubes, each of
which corresponds to a logical qubit. We thus call them many-hypercube codes.
The encoding rate is remarkably high, e.g., 30% (64 logical qubits are encoded
into 216 physical qubits). Developing a dedicated high-performance decoder, we
achieve high error thresholds even in a circuit-level noise model. Logical gate
operations are also parallelizable. Thus, the many-hypercube codes will pave
the way to high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computation.

based on polar Walsh basis functions. Using this approach, we present an
algorithm for the removal of the circular banding noise (including Airy pattern
noise) and the azimuthal banding noise. This approach is based on a formulation
of Walsh basis functions in polar coordinates for image representations. This
approach also builds upon an earlier work on a hybrid classical-quantum
algorithm for Walsh-Hadamard transforms. We provide two kinds of polar
representations using uniform area measure and uniform radial measure.
Effective smoothening and interpolating techniques are devised relevant to the
transformations between Cartesian and polar coordinates, mitigating the
challenges posed by the non-injectivity of the transformation in the context of
digital images. The hybrid classical-quantum approach presented here involves
an algorithm for Walsh-Hadamard transforms, which has a lower computational
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ compared to the well-known classical Fast
Walsh-Hadamard Transform, which has a computational complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(N \log_2 N)$. We demonstrated the applicability of our approach
through computational examples involving the removal of the circular banding
noise (including Airy pattern noise) and the azimuthal banding noise.

on a curved surface, which depends on the outer curvature and has observable
effects. In the context of multi-component quantum states, geometric momentum
should be rewritten as generally covariant geometric momentum. For a Dirac
fermion constrained on a two-dimensional hypersurface, we give the generally
covariant geometric momentum, and show that on the pseudosphere and the helical
surface there exist no curvature-induced geometric potentials. These results
verify that the dynamical quantization conditions are effective in dealing with
constrained systems on hypersurfaces, and one could obtain the generally
convariant geometric momentum and the geometric potential of a spin particle
constrained on surfaces with definite parametric equations.

                                        <span>  This article introduces an enhancement to the Grover search algorithm to
speed up computing the probability of finding good states. It suggests
incorporating a rotation phase angle determined mathematically from the
derivative of the model during the initial iteration. At each iteration, a new
phase angle is computed and used in a rotation gate around y+z axis in the
diffusion operator. The computed phase angles are optimized through an adaptive
adjustment based on the estimated increasing ratio of the consecutive
amplitudes. The findings indicate an average decrease of 28% in the required
number of iterations resulting in a faster overall process and fewer number of
quantum gates. For large search space, this improvement rises to 29.58%. Given
the computational capabilities of the computer utilized for the simulation, the
approach is applied to instances with up to 12 qubits or 4096 possible
combination of search entries.

                                        <span>  We address the problem of fundamental limitations of information extraction
from the environment in open quantum systems. We derive a model-independent,
hybrid quantum-classical solution of open dynamics in the recoil-less limit,
which includes environmental degrees of freedom. Specifying to the celebrated
Caldeira-Leggett model of hot thermal environments, ubiquitous in everyday
situations, we reveal the existence of a new lengthscale, called
distinguishability length, different from the well-known thermal de Broglie
wavelength that governs the decoherence. Interestingly, a new integral kernel,
called Quantum Fisher Information kernel, appears in the analysis. It
complements the well-known dissipation and noise kernels and satisfies
disturbance-information gain type of relations, similar to the famous
fluctuation-dissipation relation. Our results complement the existing
treatments of the Caldeira-Legget model from a non-standard and highly
non-trivial perspective of information dynamics in the environment. This leads
to a full picture of how the open evolution looks like from both the system and
the environment points of view, as well as sets limits on the precision of
indirect observations.

                                        <span>  Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices (STOVs) are structured electromagnetic fields
propagating in free space with phase singularities in the space-time domain.
Depending on the tilt of the helical phase front, STOVs can carry both
longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although STOVs have
gained significant interest in the recent years, the current understanding is
limited to the semi-classical picture. Here, we develop a quantum theory for
STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We
demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon
pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in
conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum
fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be
used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects. Our findings represent a
step towards the exploitation of quantum effects of structured light for
various applications such as OAM-based encoding protocols and platforms to
explore novel light-matter interaction in 2D material systems.

GHZ-like states, in the presence of generic spatially local, possibly strong
interactions during the measurement process. An explicit protocol, which relies
on single-qubit measurements and feedback based on polynomial-time classical
computation, achieves the Heisenberg limit. In one dimension, matrix product
state methods can be used to perform this classical calculation, while in
higher dimensions the cluster expansion underlies the efficient calculations.
The latter approach is based on an efficient classical sampling algorithm for
short-time quantum dynamics, which may be of independent interest.

                                        <span>  Certain non-Hermitian systems exhibit the skin effect, whereby the
wavefunctions become exponentially localized at one edge of the system. Such
exponential amplification of wavefunction has received significant attention
due to its potential applications in e.g., classical and quantum sensing.
However, the opposite edge of the system, featured by the exponentially
suppressed wavefunctions, remains largely unexplored. Leveraging this
phenomenon, we introduce a non-Hermitian cooling mechanism, which is
fundamentally distinct from traditional refrigeration or laser cooling
techniques. Notably, non-Hermiticity will not amplify thermal excitations, but
rather redistribute them. Hence, thermal excitations can be cooled down at one
edge of the system, and the cooling effect can be exponentially enhanced by the
number of auxiliary modes, albeit with a lower bound that depends on the
dissipative interaction with the environment. Non-Hermitian cooling does not
rely on intricate properties such as exceptional points or non-trivial
topology, and it can apply to a wide range of Bosonic modes such as photons,
phonons, magnons, etc.

it ``contains the only mystery'' of quantum mechanics. We here want to point

magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the
$^{13}$C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the
optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize $^{13}$C spins at
room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by
using a combination of surface treatment improving the $^{13}$C relaxation
($T_1$) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV
illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Monitoring the light-induced
redistribution of the NV spin state populations with electron paramagnetic
resonance, a strong polarization enhancement for the NV spin state is observed
in a narrow spectral region corresponding to about 4\% of these defect centers.
By combining adjustments to the `PulsePol' sequence and slow sample rotation,
the NV-$^{13}$C polarization transfer rate is improved further. The
hyperpolarized $^{13}$C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2 $\mu$m and 100
nm median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29 T magnetic
field), of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of
room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based
on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.

                                        <span>  A recurring challenge in quantum science and technology is the precise
control of their underlying dynamics that lead to the desired quantum
operations, often described by a set of quantum gates. These gates can be
subject to application-specific errors, leading to a dependence of their
controls on the chosen circuit, the quality measure and the gate-set itself. A
natural solution would be to apply quantum optimal control in an
application-oriented fashion. In turn, this requires the definition of a
meaningful measure of the contextual gate-set performance. Therefore, we
explore and compare the applicability of quantum process tomography, linear
inversion gate-set tomography, randomized linear gate-set tomography, and
randomized benchmarking as measures for closed-loop quantum optimal control
experiments, using a macroscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in
diamond as a test-bed. Our work demonstrates the relative trade-offs between
those measures and how to significantly enhance the gate-set performance,
leading to an improvement across all investigated methods.

                                        <span>  We investigate the distributed dense coding (DC) protocol, involving multiple
senders and a single or two receivers under the influence of non-Markovian
noise, acting on the encoded qubits transmitted from senders to the
receiver(s). We compare the effects of non-Markovianity on DC both for the
dephasing and depolarising channels. In the case of dephasing channels, we
illustrate that for some classes of states, high non-Markovian strength can
eradicate the negative influence of noisy channels which is not observed for
depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we incorporate randomness into the noise
models by replacing the Pauli matrices with random unitaries and demonstrate
the constructive impact of stochastic noise models on the quenched averaged
dense coding capacity. Interestingly, we report that the detrimental effect of
non-Markovian depolarising channels in the DC protocol can be eliminated when
randomness is added to the channel.

                                        <span>  Starting with a product initial state, squeezed (squeezed coherent) state in
one of the modes, and vacuum in the rest, we report that a circular waveguide
comprising modes coupled with varying coupling strength is capable of producing
genuine multimode entanglement (GME), quantified via the generalized geometric
measure (GGM). We demonstrate that for a fixed coupling and squeezing strength,
the GME content of the resulting state increases as the range of couplings
between the waveguides increases, although the GGM collapses and revives with
the variation of coupling strength and time. The advantage of long-range
coupling can be emphasized by measuring the area under the GGM curve, which
clearly illustrates the growing trends of GME with the increasing range of
couplings. Moreover, long-range couplings help in generating a higher GGM for a
fixed coupling strength. We analytically determine the exact expression of GGM
for systems involving an arbitrary number of modes, when all the modes interact
with each other equally. The entire analysis is performed in the phase-space
formalism. We manifest the constructive effect of disorder in the coupling
parameter, which promises a steady production of GME, independent of the
coupling strength.

                                        <span>  Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used in financial risk management,
from estimating value-at-risk (VaR) to pricing over-the-counter derivatives.
However, they come at a significant computational cost due to the number of
scenarios required for convergence. If a probability distribution is available,
Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithms can provide a quadratic speed-up
in measuring its properties as compared to their classical counterparts. Recent
studies have explored the calculation of common risk measures and the
optimisation of QAE algorithms by initialising the input quantum states with
pre-computed probability distributions. If such distributions are not available
in closed form, however, they need to be generated numerically, and the
associated computational cost may limit the quantum advantage. In this paper,
we bypass this challenge by incorporating scenario generation -- i.e.
simulation of the risk factor evolution over time to generate probability
distributions -- into the quantum computation; we refer to this process as
Quantum MC (QMC) simulations. Specifically, we assemble quantum circuits that
implement stochastic models for equity (geometric Brownian motion), interest
rate (mean-reversion models), and credit (structural, reduced-form, and rating
migration credit models) risk factors. We then integrate these models with QAE
to provide end-to-end examples for both market and credit risk use cases.

such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) and quantum
communication, we demonstrate an on-chip, room-temperature device, which
generates highly directional radially polarized photons at very high rates. The
photons are emitted from a giant CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dot (gQD)
accurately positioned at the tip of a metal nanocone centered inside a hybrid
metal-dielectric bullseye antenna. We show that due to the large and selective
Purcell enhancement specifically for the out-of-plane optical dipole of the
gQD, the emitted photons can have a very high degree of radial polarization
(>93%), based on a quantitative metric. Our study emphasizes the importance of
accurate gQD positioning for optimal radial polarization purity through
extensive experiments and simulations, which contribute to the fundamental
understanding of radial polarization in nanostructured devices and pave the way
for implementation of such systems in practical applications using structured

orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar
decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem
for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the

radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the
exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence,
we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge
to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal

                                        <span>  We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the
generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for
irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates
for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski
spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same
cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of
the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST,
$Q_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless)
constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free
higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for
irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator,
together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary
condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on
the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian
superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic
vertices.

decaying positive potentials are studied. It is shown that its resolvent is
smooth near zero and the time propagator has fast local time decay which is
very different from very short-range cases. The key element of the proof is to
establish a weaker Agmon estimate for a classically forbidden region using
exotic symbol calculus. As a byproduct, we prove that the Riesz operator is a
pseudodifferential operator with an exotic symbol.

                                        <span>  In this document, we aim to gather various results related to a
compositional/categorical approach to rigorous Statistical Mechanics. Rigorous
Statistical Mechanics is centered on the mathematical study of statistical
systems. Central concepts in this field have a natural expression in terms of
diagrams in a category that couples measurable maps and Markov kernels. We
showed that statistical systems are particular representations of partially
ordered sets (posets), that we call A-specifications, and expressed their
phases, i.e., Gibbs measures, as invariants of these representations. It opens
the way to the use of homological algebra to compute phases of statistical
systems. Two central results of rigorous Statistical Mechanics are, firstly,
the characterization of extreme Gibbs measures as it relates to the zero-one
law for extreme Gibbs measures, and, secondly, their variational principle
which states that for translation invariant Hamiltonians, Gibbs measures are
the minima of the Gibbs free energy. We showed how the characterization of
extreme Gibbs measures extends to A-specifications; we proposed an Entropy
functional for A-specifications and gave a message-passing algorithm, that
generalized the belief propagation algorithm of graphical models, to find
critical points of the associated variational free energy.

Kramers-Wannier (KW) transformation to investigate unconventional gapped
phases, their dualities, and phase transitions. Defined by a matrix of
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ elements, the BPM not only encapsulates the essence of KW
duality but also enables exploration of a broader spectrum of generalized
quantum phases and dualities. By analyzing the BPM's linear algebraic
properties, we elucidate the loss of unitarity in duality transformations and
derive general non-invertible fusion rules. Applying this framework to (1+1)D
systems yields the discovery of new dualities, shedding light on the interplay
between various Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) and Spontaneous Symmetry
Breaking (SSB) phases. Additionally, we construct a duality web that
interconnects these phases and their transitions, offering valuable insights
into relations between different quantum phases.

on a curved surface, which depends on the outer curvature and has observable
effects. In the context of multi-component quantum states, geometric momentum
should be rewritten as generally covariant geometric momentum. For a Dirac
fermion constrained on a two-dimensional hypersurface, we give the generally
covariant geometric momentum, and show that on the pseudosphere and the helical
surface there exist no curvature-induced geometric potentials. These results
verify that the dynamical quantization conditions are effective in dealing with
constrained systems on hypersurfaces, and one could obtain the generally
convariant geometric momentum and the geometric potential of a spin particle
constrained on surfaces with definite parametric equations.

                                        <span>  This paper deals with the positive mass theorem and the existence of
isoperimetric sets on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics
having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense.
  We prove that if the manifold has an end that is $C^0$-locally asymptotically
flat, and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with
vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, then
Huisken's isoperimetric mass is nonnegative. This addresses a version of a
recent conjecture of Huisken about positive isoperimetric mass theorems for
continuous metrics satisfying $R_g\geq 0$ in a weak sense. As a consequence,
any fill-in of a truncation of a Schwarzschild space with negative ADM mass has
nonnegative isoperimetric mass.
  Moreover, in case the whole manifold is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat and
the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower
bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, we prove that, as a large
scale effect, isoperimetric sets with arbitrarily large volume exist.

                                        <span>  We show that it is possible to perform Heisenberg-limited metrology on
GHZ-like states, in the presence of generic spatially local, possibly strong
interactions during the measurement process. An explicit protocol, which relies
on single-qubit measurements and feedback based on polynomial-time classical
computation, achieves the Heisenberg limit. In one dimension, matrix product
state methods can be used to perform this classical calculation, while in
higher dimensions the cluster expansion underlies the efficient calculations.
The latter approach is based on an efficient classical sampling algorithm for
short-time quantum dynamics, which may be of independent interest.

                                        <span>  This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD)
technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses
time embedding and Mahalanobis scaling to enhance analysis and prediction of
high dimensional dynamical systems. The time embedding expands the observation
space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis
scaling, applied to kernel or random Fourier features, adjusts observations
based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where
good features are not a priori known. We find that the Mahalanobis scaling from
FKMD can be used for effective dimensionality reduction of alanine dipeptide
data. We also show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional Lorenz
attractor and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.

                                        <span>  Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in
various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have
hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter
with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such
expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which
can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the
differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential
systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the
generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and
Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms.
Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of
considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis
involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica
package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required
steps.

the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients
include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the
longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum
$Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four
products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By
exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their
modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known
three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by
Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring,
Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective,
Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and
Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D
$R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these
existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster
algebra.

three-point and bulk-boundary structure constants in Liouville conformal field
theory (LCFT) agree respectively with the formula proposed by Ponsot-Techsner
(2002) and by Hosomichi (2001). These formulas also respectively describe the
fusion kernel and modular kernel of the Virasoro conformal blocks, which are
important functions in various contexts of mathematical physics. As an
intermediate step, we obtain the formula for the boundary reflection
coefficient of LCFT proposed by Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (2000). Our
proof relies on the boundary Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov differential
equation recently proved by the first named author, and inputs from the
coupling theory of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) and Schramm Loewner
evolution. Our results supply all the structure constants needed to perform the
conformal bootstrap for boundary LCFT. They also yield exact descriptions for
the joint law of the area and boundary lengths of basic LQG surfaces, including

                                        <span>  We present efficient data-driven approaches to predict Feynman periods in
$\phi^4$-theory from properties of the underlying Feynman graphs. We find that
the numbers of cuts and cycles determines the period to approximately 2%
accuracy. Hepp bound and Martin invariant allow to predict the period with
accuracy much better than 1%. In most cases, the period is a multi-linear
function of the parameters in question. Besides classical correlation analysis,
we also investigate the usefulness of machine-learning algorithms to predict
the period. When sufficiently many properties of the graph are used, the period
can be predicted with better than 0.05% relative accuracy.
  We use one of the constructed prediction models for weighted Monte-Carlo
sampling of Feynman graphs, and compute the primitive contribution to the beta
function of $\phi^4$-theory at $L\in \left \lbrace 13, 14, 15, 16 \right
\rbrace $ loops. Our results confirm the previously known numerical estimates
of the primitive beta function and improve their accuracy. Compared to uniform
random sampling of graphs, our new algorithm reaches 35-fold higher accuracy in
fixed runtime, or requires 1000-fold less runtime to reach a given accuracy.
  The data set of all periods computed for this work, combined with a previous
data set, is made publicly available. Besides the physical application, it
could serve as a benchmark for graph-based machine learning algorithms.

                                        <span>  There is strong observational evidence that almost every large galaxy has a
supermassive black hole at its center. It is of fundamental importance to know
whether such black holes are described by the standard Kerr solution in General
Relativity (GR) or by another black hole solution. An interesting alternative
is the so-called disformal Kerr black holes which exist within the framework of
degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories of gravity. The
departure from the standard Kerr black hole spacetime is parametrized by a
parameter $D$, called $\textit{disformal parameter}$. In the present work, we
discuss the capability of LISA to detect the disformal parameter. For this
purpose, we study Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRI's) around disformal Kerr
black holes within the framework of the quadrupole hybrid formalism. Even when
the disformal parameter is very small, its effect on the globally accumulated
phase of the gravitational waveform of an EMRI can be significant due to the
large number of cycles in the LISA band made by the small compact object. We
show that LISA will in principle be able to detect and measure extremely small
values of the disformal parameter which in turn, can be seen as an assessment
of LISA's ability to detect very small deviations from the Kerr geometry.

                                        <span>  We consider the two-dimensional Schwinger model of a massless charged fermion
coupled to an Abelian gauge field on a fixed de Sitter background. The theory
admits an exact solution, first examined by Jayewardena, and can be analyzed
efficiently using Euclidean methods. We calculate fully non-perturbative,
gauge-invariant correlation functions of the electric field as well as the
fermion and analyze these correlators in the late-time limit. We compare these
results with the perturbative picture, for example by verifying the one-loop
contribution to the fermion two-point function, as predicted from the exact
solution, matches the direct computation of the one-loop Feynman diagram. We
demonstrate many features endemic of quantum field theory in de Sitter space,
including the appearance of late-time logarithms, their resummation to de
Sitter invariant expressions, and Boltzmann suppressed non-perturbative
phenomena, with surprising late-time features.

irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator,
together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary
condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on

proportional to the free equation of motion (EOM) in a Schwinger-Keldysh
formalism. They are relevant to the correct calculation of correlation
functions of curvature perturbations in the context of inflationary Universe.
We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the
operator or the path-integral formalism, but they give the same correlation
functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's
consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll
inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold
in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments
on loop calculations.

                                        <span>  Recently there has been an increasing interest in the study of generalized
symmetries in dimensions higher than two. This has lead to the discovery of
various manifestations of generalized symmetries, notably higher-group and
non-invertible symmetries, in four dimensions. In this paper we shall examine
what happens to this structure when the 4d theory is compactified to lower
dimensions, specifically to 3d and 2d, where we shall be mainly interested in
generalized symmetry structures whose origin can be linked to mixed
flavor-gauge anomalies. We discuss several aspects of the compactification, and
in particular argue that under certain conditions the discussed generalized
symmetry structure may trivialize in the infrared. Nevertheless, we show that
even when this happens the presence of the 4d generalized symmetry structure
may still leave an imprint on the low-energy theory in terms of additional 't
Hooft anomalies or by breaking part of the symmetry. We apply and illustrate
this using known examples of compactifications from four dimensions,
particularly, the reduction of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $U(N_c)$ SQCD on a circle to
3d and on a sphere to 2d.

the nonlinearity, which we apply to weakly nonlinear classical field theories.
Our solution is a variant of the Prigogine diagrammatic method, and is based on
an analogy between the Liouville equation in infinite volume and scattering in
quantum mechanics, described by the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The motivation
for our work is wave turbulence: a broad class of nonlinear classical field
theories are believed to have a stationary turbulent state -- a
far-from-equilibrium state, even at weak coupling. Our method provides an
efficient way to derive properties of the weak wave turbulent state. A central
object in these studies, which is a reduction of the Liouville equation, is the
kinetic equation, which governs the occupation numbers of the modes. All
properties of wave turbulence to date are based on the kinetic equation found
at leading order in the weak nonlinearity. We explicitly obtain the kinetic
equation to next-to-leading order.

                                        <span>  It has long been known that weakly nonlinear field theories can have a
late-time stationary state that is not the thermal state, but a wave turbulent
state with a far-from-equilibrium cascade of energy. We go beyond the existence
of the wave turbulent state, studying fluctuations about the wave turbulent
state. Specifically, we take a classical field theory with an arbitrary quartic
interaction and add dissipation and Gaussian-random forcing. Employing the path
integral relation between stochastic classical field theories and quantum field
theories, we give a prescription, in terms of Feynman diagrams, for computing
correlation functions in this system. We explicitly compute the two-point and
four-point functions of the field to next-to-leading order in the coupling.
Through an appropriate choice of forcing and dissipation, these correspond to
correlation functions in the wave turbulent state. In particular, we derive the
kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.

                                        <span>  Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in
various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have
hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter
with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such
expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which
can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the
differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential
systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the
generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and
Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms.
Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of
considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis
involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica
package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required
steps.

                                        <span>  We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as
a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through
torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the
critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results
with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we
found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark
matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from
the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an
attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing
features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy
since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily
negligible at early times.

models of the New General Relativity type. Then we apply them to analysis of
cosmological perturbations in the (simplest) spatially flat cosmologies. Strong
coupling issues around Minkowski spacetime are seen for many special cases of
these models. At the same time, the behaviour of the most general
three-parameter case seems to be very robust, presumably always with only the
eight first-class constraints coming from diffeomorphisms. Also the case of the
so-called 1-parameter New GR doesn't show any discontinuity between Minkowski
and the cosmology, though without showing any deviations from GR which would be
observable at this level either.

the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients
include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the
longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum
$Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four
products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By
exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their
modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known
three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by
Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring,
Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective,
Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and
Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D
$R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these
existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster
algebra.

three-point and bulk-boundary structure constants in Liouville conformal field
theory (LCFT) agree respectively with the formula proposed by Ponsot-Techsner
(2002) and by Hosomichi (2001). These formulas also respectively describe the
fusion kernel and modular kernel of the Virasoro conformal blocks, which are
important functions in various contexts of mathematical physics. As an
intermediate step, we obtain the formula for the boundary reflection
coefficient of LCFT proposed by Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (2000). Our
proof relies on the boundary Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov differential
equation recently proved by the first named author, and inputs from the
coupling theory of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) and Schramm Loewner
evolution. Our results supply all the structure constants needed to perform the
conformal bootstrap for boundary LCFT. They also yield exact descriptions for
the joint law of the area and boundary lengths of basic LQG surfaces, including
quantum triangles and two-pointed quantum disks.

                                        <span>  The four characteristic oscillation frequencies of accretion flows are, in
addition to the Keplerian orbital frequency, often discussed in the context of
the time variability of the black hole and neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs). These are namely the frequencies of the axisymmetric radial
and vertical epicyclic oscillations, and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric
oscillations corresponding to the periastron (radial) and Lense-Thirring
(vertical) precessions. In this context, we investigate the effect of the
quadrupole moment of a slowly rotating NS and provide complete formulae for
calculating these oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their
convenient approximations. Simple formulae corresponding to the geodesic limit
of a slender torus (and test particle motion) and the limit of a marginally
overflowing torus (torus exhibiting a critical cusp) are presented, and
furthermore, more general approximate formulae are included to allow
calculations for arbitrarily thick tori. We provide the Wolfram Mathematica
code used for our calculations together with C++ and PYTHON codes for
calculations of the frequencies. Our formulae can be used for various
calculations describing the astrophysical signatures of the NSs' superdense
matter equation of state. For instance, we demonstrate that, even for a given
fixed number of free parameters, a model accounting for fluid flow precession
better matches the frequencies of twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations observed
in NS LMXBs than a model using geodesic precession.

Einstein, states that ``gravity" can be mimicked locally by going to an
``accelerated frame of reference". As highlighted by Synge, the physical
content of this principle remains obscure in so far as it does not refer to the
Riemann tensor $R_{abcd}$, which encodes the true effects of gravity. We here
give the acceleration profile of a $Born$ rigid, Rindler$esque$, frame that can
mimic a gravitational field corresponding to a given $R_{abcd}$. The
generalised deviation equation that yields this result also has Centrifugal and
Coriolis terms appearing in a purely relational context, yielding a similar
connection between angular velocity of rotating, rigid inertial frames and the
Riemann tensor. We comment briefly on implications for Mach principle.

                                        <span>  We present a full general relativistic analytic solution for a
radiation-pressure supported equilibrium fluid torus orbiting a rotating
neutron star (NS). Previously developed analytical methods are thoroughly
applied in the Hartle-Thorne geometry, including the effects of both the NS's
angular momentum and quadrupole moment. The structure, size and shape of the
torus are explored, focusing especially on the critically thick solution - the
cusp tori. For the astrophysically relevant range of NS parameters, we examine
how our findings differ from those obtained for the Schwarzschild spacetime.
The solutions for rotating stars display signatures of the interplay between
relativistic and Newtonian effects where the impact of NS angular momentum and
quadrupole moment are almost counterbalanced at the given radius. Nevertheless,
the spacetime parameters still strongly influence the size of tori, which can
be shown in a coordinate-independent way. Finally, we discuss the importance of
the size of the central neutron star, determining whether or not the
surrounding torus may exist. We provide a set of tools in a Wolfram Mathematica
code, which poses a basis allowing for a further investigation of the impact of
the NSs' superdense matter equation of state on the spectral and temporal
behaviour of accretion tori.

                                        <span>  There is strong observational evidence that almost every large galaxy has a
supermassive black hole at its center. It is of fundamental importance to know
whether such black holes are described by the standard Kerr solution in General
Relativity (GR) or by another black hole solution. An interesting alternative
is the so-called disformal Kerr black holes which exist within the framework of
degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories of gravity. The
departure from the standard Kerr black hole spacetime is parametrized by a
parameter $D$, called $\textit{disformal parameter}$. In the present work, we
discuss the capability of LISA to detect the disformal parameter. For this
purpose, we study Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRI's) around disformal Kerr
black holes within the framework of the quadrupole hybrid formalism. Even when
the disformal parameter is very small, its effect on the globally accumulated
phase of the gravitational waveform of an EMRI can be significant due to the
large number of cycles in the LISA band made by the small compact object. We
show that LISA will in principle be able to detect and measure extremely small
values of the disformal parameter which in turn, can be seen as an assessment
of LISA's ability to detect very small deviations from the Kerr geometry.

evolution is an interesting aspect of study in cosmology. Here, we investigate
the anisotropic locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-I (LRS-BI)
spacetime under the $f(Q)$ gravity of symmetric teleparallel theory equivalent
to the GR (STEGR) as a dynamical system and try to understand the role of
anisotropy in the evolution of its various phases. For this work, we consider
two models, viz., $f(Q) = -\,(Q+ 2\Lambda)$ and $f(Q) = -\, \beta Q^{n}$ to
study the critical points and stability of the LRS-BI Universe. In both the
models, it is found that the various phases like radiation-dominated,
matter-dominated, and dark energy-dominated phases are heteroclinically
connected, and there is some role of anisotropy in the evolution of these
phases of the Universe. However, for both the models, there are some unphysical
solutions too depending upon the values of model parameters $\beta$ and $n$
along with the anisotropic parameter $\alpha$.

structure of KG-oscillators in a mixed magnetic field (in the sense that it has
the usually described as a uniform and a non-uniform magnetic fields, each at a
time) introduced by the 4-vector potential $A_\mu=(0,0,A_\varphi,0)$, where
$A_\varphi=B_1 r^2/2+B_2 r$, and $B_1$ and $B_2$ are magnetic field strengths.
We also discuss and report the effects of such a mixed magnetic field on the
spectra of KG-oscillators in cosmic string rainbow gravity. In so doing, we
introduce a new and quite handy \textit{conditionally exact solution}
associated with the truncation of the biconfluent Heun functions into
polynomials. Using a loop quantum gravity motivated rainbow functions, we
observe interesting effects when the magnetic field strength $B_2$ grows up
from zero. Such effects include energy levels crossings which, in this case,
turns the spectra of the KG-oscillators upside down. Moreover, Landau-like
signature on the spectra are observed and discussed. Yet, interestingly, we
also observe that rainbow gravity affects the magnetic field as well, in the
sense that the magnetic field becomes probe particle energy-dependent one.

We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the

functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's
consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll
inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold
in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments

total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modelling an
isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial
data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if
$m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must
be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with
spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find
the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space
and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case.
As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime
positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.

                                        <span>  This paper explores the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and
scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from the inflation potential with a
tiny bump. We propose a Lorentz function that makes a tiny bump characteristic
of the inflation model potential. This property makes the scalar field move
locally ultra slowly, which not only makes the primordial curvature power
spectrum have $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ peaks at a small scale but also satisfies
observational constraints of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on a large
scale. Specifically, we calculate the abundances of PBHs for different mass
ranges in this model, where PBHs with mass $10^{-12}M_\odot$ can make up almost
all dark matter and PBHs with mass $10^{-5}M_\odot$ can explain OGLE
ultrashort-timescale microlensing events. Moreover, we find that SIGWs
accompanying the PBHs can be tested by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA),
TianQin, Taiji, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and DECIGO. As for
the parameter set I, the consequent SIGWs can explain the NANOGrav 12.5yrs
signal.

shift of photons emitted by massive geodesic particles circularly orbiting a
black hole in a general spherically symmetric background. Our general relations
are presented in terms of the metric components and their derivatives that
characterize the black hole parameters. As a concrete example of this general
relativistic approach, a special case is studied by applying the formalism to a
nonsingular black hole conformally related to the Schwarzchild solution that
possesses a length scale parameter $l$ and an integer parameter $N$ in addition
to the black hole mass. Besides, we express the nonsingular black hole mass in
terms of the observational redshift/blueshift. Finally, we investigate the
effects of the free parameters of the conformal gravity theory on the
observational frequency shift and compare results with those of the standard
Schwarzschild black hole.

                                        <span>  We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as
a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through
torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the
critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results
with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we
found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark
matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from
the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an
attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing
features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy
since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily
negligible at early times.

cosmological perturbations in the (simplest) spatially flat cosmologies. Strong
coupling issues around Minkowski spacetime are seen for many special cases of
these models. At the same time, the behaviour of the most general
three-parameter case seems to be very robust, presumably always with only the
eight first-class constraints coming from diffeomorphisms. Also the case of the
so-called 1-parameter New GR doesn't show any discontinuity between Minkowski
and the cosmology, though without showing any deviations from GR which would be
observable at this level either.

the precise determination of $|V_{ud}|$. Based on a general assumptions of the

$F_{T_z}$ which involve nuclear matrix elements of isovector monopole operators

$\delta_\text{C}$ to measurable electroweak nuclear radii is established,
providing an experimental gauge of the theory accuracy of $\delta_\text{C}$. We
outline a strategy to perform ab-initio calculations of $F_{T_z}$ based on the
Lanczos algorithm, and discuss its similarity with other
nuclear-structure-dependent inputs in nuclear beta decays.

                                        <span>  We have employed an all-particle Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster
theory to probe $6s^2{\;^1}S_{0} - 6s6p{\;^3P^o_{0}}$ clock transition in an
even isotope of Pb$^{2+}$. We have computed the excitation energies for several
low lying states, E1 and M1 transition amplitudes, and the lifetime of the
clock state. Moreover, we have also calculated the electric dipole
polarizability of the ground state using perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster
theory. To improve the accuracy of results, we incorporated the corrections
from the relativistic and QED effects in all our calculations. Contributions
from the triple excitations are accounted perturbatively. Our computed
excitation energies are in excellent agreement with the experimental values for
all states. Our computed lifetime, $10.45\times10^{6}$ s, of clock state is
$\approx$ 16\% larger than the previously reported value using CI+MBPT [Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 013201 (2021)]. Based on our analysis, we find that the
contributions from the {\em valence-valence} electron correlations from higher
energy configurations and the corrections from the perturbative triples and QED
effects are essential to get accurate clock properties in Pb$^{2+}$. Our
computed value of dipole polarizability is in good agreement with the available
theory and experimental data.

                                        <span>  We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin
states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework
yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a
generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types --
asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the
last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics
constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces
that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin
statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin
entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another
species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an
internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase
or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust
operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant
quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally
probed.

known ultrafast nonlinear responses in the mid-infrared frequency range across
all condensed matter systems. Beyond harmonic generation and frequency mixing,
these nonlinearities can be leveraged for ultrafast optical switching and power
limiting, based on tailored transitions from strong to weak polaritonic
coupling. Here, we demonstrate synergistic optimization of materials and
photonic nanostructures to achieve large reflection contrast in ultrafast
polaritonic metasurface limiters. The devices are based on optimized
semiconductor heterostructure materials that minimize the intersubband
transition linewidth and reduce absorption in optically saturated
nanoresonators, achieving a record-high reflection contrast of 54%
experimentally. We also discuss opportunities to further boost the metrics of
performance of this class of ultrafast limiters, showing that reflection
contrast as high as 94% may be realistically achieved using all-dielectric
intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces.

                                        <span>  Designing a good transfer channel for arbitrary quantum states in spin chains
implies optimizing a cost function, usually the averaged fidelity of
transmission. The fidelity of transmission measures how much the transferred
state resembles the state prepared at the beginning of the transfer protocol.
When averaged over all the possible initial states, the figure of merit
quantifies the quality of the protocol. There are proposals for optimizing a
given Hamiltonian to accomplish a particular task. The transfer of quantum
states is one of them. In particular, we consider the design of Heisenberg spin
chains using a genetic algorithm. This very efficient algorithm allows us to
study different properties of Hamiltonians with good to excellent transfer
ability. One apparent drawback of using a random search method is that it
results in exchange coefficient strengths that change abruptly from site to
site. Modifying the cost function, we obtain Hamiltonians with exchange
coefficients varying smoothly along the chain length. Our results show that the
smoothed Hamiltonians have the same, or less, transfer ability than the rough
ones, and both kinds show similar robustness against static disorder. By
studying the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians with
varying transfer abilities, we determine the ensemble of random matrices to
which the spectra belong.

theories (2d CFTs) due to the growth of operators induced by inhomogeneous and
homogeneous Hamiltonians by investigating the time dependence of the partition
function, energy density, and entanglement entropy. The non-equilibrium
processes considered in this paper are constructed out of the Lorentzian and
Euclidean time evolution governed by different Hamiltonians. We explore the
effect of the time ordering on entanglement dynamics so that we find that in a
free boson CFT and RCFTs, this time ordering does not affect the entanglement
entropy, while in the holographic CFTs, it does. Our main finding is that in
the holographic CFTs, the non-unitary time evolution induced by the
inhomogeneous Hamiltonian can retain the initial state information longer than
in the unitary time evolution.

                                        <span>  Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner
crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The
classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin
chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is
determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity.
The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic
potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with
the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic
structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also
on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the
thermodynamic limit for $\alpha>1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it
disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However,
due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of
the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We
discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to
observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics
are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the
interplay between frustration and interactions.

                                        <span>  We systematically derive relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics based on the
method of quantum nonlinear projection operator. Morozov's nonlinear projection
operator is a generalization of the well-known linear Mori-Zwanzig projection
operator method, from which one can account for the nonlinear interaction
between macroscopic modes. The quantum generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin
equations are also obtained using this formalism, which are fundamentally
important in non-equilibrium statistical physics. As an application, the
relativistic stochastic hydrodynamic equations with Gaussian noises are
derived, which are applicable in studying anomalous transport phenomena near
critical points. The possible extension to include multiplicative noises is
also discussed.

                                        <span>  Quantum optimal control theory (QOCT) can be used to design the shape of
electromagnetic pulses that implement operations on quantum devices. By using
non-trivially shaped waveforms, gates can be made significantly faster than
those built by concatenating monochromatic pulses. Recently, we applied this
technique to the control of molecular spin qudits modelled with Schr\"odinger's
equation and showed it can speed up operations, helping mitigate the effects of
decoherence [Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 17}, 064028 (2022)]. However, short gate
times result in large optimal pulse amplitudes, which may not be experimentally
accessible. Introducing bounds to the amplitudes then unavoidably leads to
longer operation times, for which decoherence can no longer be neglected. Here,
we study how to improve this procedure by applying QOCT on top of Lindblad's
equation, to design control pulses accounting for decoherence already in the
optimization process. In addition, we introduce a formulation that allows us to
bound the maximum amplitude and frequency of the signals, which are the typical
limitations of waveform generators. The pulses we obtain consistently enhance
operation fidelities compared to those achieved with Schr\"odinger's equation
across various target gates and durations, demonstrating the flexibility and
robustness of our method. The improvement is larger the shorter the spin
coherence time $T_{2}$.

non-Gaussian states has garnered increasing attention. In this study, we
propose a scheme to input the coherent state mixed with photon-catalyzed
squeezed vacuum state into the Mach-Zender interferometer to enhance phase
measurement accuracy. The findings demonstrate that photon catalysis,
particularly multi-photon catalysis, can effectively improve the phase
sensitivity of parity detection and the quantum Fisher information. Moreover,
the situation of photon losses in practical measurement was studied. The
results indicate that external dissipation has a greater influence on phase
sensitivity than the internal dissipation. Compared to input coherent state
mixed with squeezed vacuum state, the utilization of coherent state mixed
photon-catalyzed squeezed vacuum state, particularly the mixed multi-photon
catalyzed squeezed vacuum state as input, can enhance the phase sensitivity and
quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, the phase measurement accuracy can
exceed the standard quantum limit, and even surpass the Heisenberg limit. This
research is expected to significantly contribute to quantum precision
measurement.

to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period.
Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in
entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due
to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint
that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured
in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and
inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive
measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order
correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the
intrinsic alignment.

                                        <span>  The idea that the dynamical properties of quantum systems are invariably
relative to other systems has recently regained currency. Using Relational
Quantum Mechanics (RQM) for a case study, this paper calls attention to a
question that has been underappreciated in the debate about quantum relativism:
the question of whether relativity iterates. Are there absolute facts about the
properties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this
again a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known
form) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP),
and thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a
crucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction
outcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the
widespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead
necessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts.
I conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist
versions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the
need for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration
principle for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.

error correction, and cryptography. Color centers in solids are one of the
leading platforms for quantum networking due to the availability of a nuclear
spin memory that can be entangled with the optically active electronic spin
through dynamical decoupling sequences. Creating electron-nuclear entangled
states in these systems is a difficult task as the always-on hyperfine
interactions prohibit complete isolation of the target dynamics from the
unwanted spin bath. While this emergent cross-talk can be alleviated by
prolonging the entanglement generation, the gate durations quickly exceed
coherence times. Here we show how to prepare high-quality GHZ$_M$-like states
with minimal cross-talk. We introduce the $M$-tangling power of an evolution
operator, which allows us to verify genuine all-way correlations. Using
experimentally measured hyperfine parameters of an NV center spin in diamond
coupled to carbon-13 lattice spins, we show how to use sequential or
single-shot entangling operations to prepare GHZ$_M$-like states of up to
$M=10$ qubits within time constraints that saturate bounds on $M$-way
correlations. We study the entanglement of mixed electron-nuclear states and
develop a non-unitary $M$-tangling power which additionally captures
correlations arising from all unwanted nuclear spins. We further derive a
non-unitary $M$-tangling power which incorporates the impact of electronic
dephasing errors on the $M$-way correlations. Finally, we inspect the
performance of our protocols in the presence of experimentally reported pulse
errors, finding that XY decoupling sequences can lead to high-fidelity GHZ
state preparation.

                                        <span>  A spontaneous symmetry-breaking order is conventionally described by a
tensor-product wave-function of some few-body clusters. We discuss a type of
symmetry-breaking orders, dubbed entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders,
which cannot be realized by any tensor-product state. Given a symmetry breaking
pattern, we propose a criterion to diagnose if the symmetry-breaking order is
entanglement-enabled, by examining the compatibility between the symmetries and
the tensor-product description. For concreteness, we present an infinite family
of exactly solvable gapped models on one-dimensional lattices with
nearest-neighbor interactions, whose ground states exhibit entanglement-enabled
symmetry-breaking orders from a discrete symmetry breaking. In addition, these
ground states have gapless edge modes protected by the unbroken symmetries. We
also propose a construction to realize entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking
orders with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Under the unbroken
symmetries, some of our examples can be viewed as symmetry-protected
topological states that are beyond the conventional classifications.

                                        <span>  We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin
states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework
yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a
generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types --
asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the
last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics
constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces
that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin
statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin
entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another
species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an
internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase
or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust
operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant
quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally
probed.

                                        <span>  We investigate a model many-body system of spinless Fermi gas in two
dimensions, where the bare two-body interaction is repulsive and takes the form
of a soft-core disk potential. We obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of
this model by numerical functional renormalization group (FRG), which retains
the effective interaction vertices in all channels to provide a detailed
picture of how Cooper pairing emerges under the renormalization flow. The
repulsion drives the system to a series of superfluid states with higher
angular momentum paring, for example in the $f$- and $h$-wave channels instead
of the $p$-wave channel. This is in sharp contrast to the original
Kohn-Luttinger mechanism where pairing of very large angular momenta and
exponentially small transition temperature was predicted. We trace the
stabilization and enhancement of $f$- and $h$-wave pairing back to the momentum
dependence of the bare interaction. A perturbative calculation is carried out
to show that while the second order Kohn-Luttinger diagrams provide a
qualitative understanding of the onsets of the various superfluid phases, they
are unable to accurately capture the phase boundaries predicted by FRG. Our
findings suggest that tuning the shape of the interaction potential offers a
promising route to achieve stronger ``pairing glue" and to realize nontrivial
superfluid phases in repulsive Fermi gases beyond the scope of the original
Kohn-Luttinger analysis.

                                        <span>  Quantum networks lead to novel notions of locality and correlations and an
important problem concerns the question of which quantum states can be
experimentally prepared with a given network structure and devices and which
not. We prove that all multi-qubit graph states arising from a connected graph
cannot originate from any quantum network with bipartite sources, as long as
feed-forward and quantum memories are not available. Moreover, the fidelity of
a multi-qubit graph state and any network state cannot exceed $9/10$. Similar
results can also be established for a large class of multi-qudit graph states.

Onsager rate equations, which model the irreversible dynamics of a system near
a steady state. By redefining the currents, I propose a version of the
equations with a symmetric transport tensor without assuming any detailed
balance. With a more conventional definition of the currents, I propose another
version where the transport tensor may not be symmetric, and I give the precise
condition for its symmetry. A reasonable definition of quantum detailed balance
is shown to be a sufficient, though not necessary, condition. The relations and
relative merits of the two versions, as well as their connection to physical
systems, are discussed.

Moreover, we calculate the absolute zeta function of the quantized model for

                                        <span>  Several classes of quantum circuits have been shown to provide a quantum
computational advantage under certain assumptions. The study of ever more
restricted classes of quantum circuits capable of quantum advantage is
motivated by possible simplifications in experimental demonstrations. In this
paper we study the efficiency of measurement-based quantum computation with a
completely flat temporal ordering of measurements. We propose new constructions
for the deterministic computation of arbitrary Boolean functions, drawing on
correlations present in multi-qubit Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ)
states. We characterize the necessary measurement complexity using the Clifford
hierarchy, and also generally decrease the number of qubits needed with respect
to previous constructions. In particular, we identify a family of Boolean
functions for which deterministic evaluation using non-adaptive MBQC is
possible, featuring quantum advantage in width and number of gates with respect
to classical circuits.

correspondence between a quantum state of dimension $d$ and $d-1$ qubits
represented as $d-1$ points in the Bloch sphere. Using the theory of symmetry
class of tensors, we present a simple scheme for constructing $d-1$ points on
the Bloch sphere and the corresponding $d-1$ qubits representing a
$d$-dimensional quantum state. Additionally, we demonstrate how the inner
product of two $d$-dimensional quantum states can be expressed as a permanent
of a matrix related to their $(d-1)$-qubit state representations. Extension of
the result to mixed states is also considered.

thermal devices performing thermodynamic tasks such as refrigeration or heat
pumping. The possibility of enhancing the performance of thermodynamic
operations by means of quantum coherence is of particular interest but requires
an adequate characterization of heat and work at the quantum level. In this
work, we demonstrate that the presence of even small amounts of coherence in
the thermal reservoirs powering a three-terminal machine, enables the
appearance of combined and hybrid modes of operation, where either different
resources are combined to perform a single thermodynamic task, or more than one
task is performed at the same time. We determine the performance of such
coherence-enabled modes of operation obtaining their power and efficiency. In
the case of hybrid regimes, the presence of coherence in the hot bath allows
for an increase in power while maintaining high efficiencies. On the other
hand, in combined regimes, a contrasting behavior emerges whereby coherence has
a detrimental impact on power output and efficiency.

                                        <span>  Three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators have been shown to reach
lifetimes of the order of a second by maximizing the cavity volume relative to
its surface, using better materials, and improving surface treatments. Such
cavities represent an ideal platform for quantum computing with bosonic qubits,
but their efficient control remains an outstanding problem since the large mode
volume results in inefficient coupling to nonlinear elements used for their
control. Moreover, this coupling induces additional cavity decay via the
inverse Purcell effect which can easily destroy the advantage of a long
intrinsic lifetime. Here, we discuss conditions on, and protocols for,
efficient utilization of these ultra-high-quality microwave cavities as
memories for conventional superconducting qubits. We show that, surprisingly,
efficient write and read operations with ultra-high-quality cavities does not
require similar quality factors for the qubits and other nonlinear elements
used to control them. Through a combination of analytical and numerical
calculations, we demonstrate that efficient coupling to cavities with
second-scale lifetime is possible with state-of-the-art transmon and SNAIL
devices and outline a route towards controlling cavities with even higher
quality factors. Our work explores a potentially viable roadmap towards using
ultra-high-quality microwave cavity resonators for storing and processing
information encoded in bosonic qubits.

quantum annealers. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model that
is based on the Ising structure and can be efficiently trained using gradient
descent. We provide a mathematical characterization of the training process,
which is based upon optimizing a loss function whose partial derivatives are
not explicitly calculated but estimated by the Ising machine itself. Moreover,
we present some experimental results on the training and execution of the
proposed learning model. These results point out new possibilities offered by
Ising machines for different learning tasks. In particular, in the quantum
realm, the quantum resources are used for both the execution and the training
of the model, providing a promising perspective in quantum machine learning.

imaginary couplings are respectively solved through the Bogoliubov operators
approach. Transcendental functions responsible for exact solutions are derived,
whose zeros produce the complete spectra. Exceptional points (EPs) can be
identified in terms of the transcendental function. The EP is formed in the two
nearest-neighboring excited energy levels, and shifts towards lower coupling
strength at higher energy levels. Interestingly, under the resonant condition
in the non-Hermitian two-photon QRM, the lowest two excited states within the
same parity in the even photonic number subspace coalesce at an EP, but take
always the purely real energy, in sharp contrast to the conventional EP in the
non-Hermitian systems. For both non-Hermitian QRMs, the fidelity susceptibility
goes to negative infinity at the EPs, consistent with the recent observations
in non-Hermitian systems. All eigenstates can be labeled by the conserved
energy and the QRM parity, we argue that the non-Hermitian QRMs are also
integrable, similar to their Hermitian counterparts.

algorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum
Neural Networks (QNNs), on prototypical problems under controlled entanglement
environments. We find that for the MAX-CUT problem solved using QAOA, the
fidelity as a function of entanglement is highly dependent on the number of
layers, layout of edges in the graph, and edge density, generally exhibiting
that a high number of layers indicates a higher resilience to truncation of
entanglement. This is in contrast to previous studies based on no more than
four QAOA layers which show that the fidelity of QAOA follows a scaling law
with respect to the entanglement per qubit of the system. Contrarily, in the
case of QNNs, trained circuits with high test accuracies are underpinned by
higher entanglement, with any enforced limitation in entanglement resulting in
a sharp decline in test accuracy. This is corroborated by the entanglement
entropy of these circuits which is consistently high suggesting that, unlike
QAOA, QNNs may require quantum devices capable of generating highly entangled
states. Overall our work provides a deeper understanding of the role of
entanglement in the working of variational quantum algorithms which may help to
implement these algorithms on NISQ-era quantum hardware in a way that maximises
their accuracies.

                                        <span>  The Kuramoto model has provided deep insights into synchronization phenomena
and remains an important paradigm to study the dynamics of coupled oscillators.
Yet, despite its success, the asynchronous regime in the Kuramoto model has
received limited attention. Here, we adapt and enhance the mean-field approach
originally proposed by Stiller and Radons [Phys. Rev. E 58 (1998)] to study the
asynchronous state in the Kuramoto model with a finite number of oscillators
and with disordered connectivity. By employing an iterative stochastic mean
field (IMF) approximation, the complex N-oscillator system can effectively be
reduced to a one-dimensional dynamics, both for homogeneous and heterogeneous
networks. This method allows us to investigate the power spectra of individual
oscillators as well as of the multiplicative "network noise" in the Kuramoto
model in the asynchronous regime. By taking into account the finite system size
and disorder in the connectivity, our findings become relevant for the dynamics
of coupled oscillators that appear in the context of biological or technical
systems.

considered in this work. The model under consideration is based on a
double-averaging concept which in turn is described by the time-averaging
technique characteristic of the turbulence k-epsilon model and by the
volume-averaging methodology that is used to model unstable flows through
porous media. The functions of turbulence viscosity, turbulence diffusion and
turbulence production are assumed to be unbounded with respect to the turbulent
kinetic energy. For the associated initial-and boundary-value problem, we prove
the existence of suitable weak solutions.

pseudo-metric. Furthermore, combining our current results with the results of

explicit semiclassical asymptotic eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator for
high-energy bound states in graphene in magnetic field. When considering
excited states in graphene, a distortion called trigonal warping begins to play
an~important role, see [7], [12]. We are dealing with a~trigonal warping
correction, considering it to be small. While the standard semiclassical
methods allow one to solve the eigenequations for operators if and only if
quantization conditions are met, we, based on article [1], develop approaches
that can be used in case these conditions are violated. The complete symbol
turns out to be only close to integrable, which brings its own difficulties.
The present paper relies heavily on the results from [3].

However, most hyperelastic models are phenomenological material models. Based
on statistical mechanics and molecular chain configuration, 8 chain model or
Arruda-Boyce model is a physical model which can be used to understand how
microstructures of chains affect macroscopic mechanical properties of polymers
and soft tissues. Mechanical properties of many polymers and soft tissues are
directional dependent. Polymer matrix can be reinforced by fibers. For soft
tissues, ligaments and tendons will lead to anisotropic properties. Since
matrix and reinforcements are composed of similar microstructural molecular
chains, they can be modeled by using the same mathematical model. In this
paper, a series of 8 chain models is used to understand composite properties.
That is, an isotropic 8 chain model will be used to model matrix and
anisotropic 8 chain models will be used to model fibers. Replacing I_1 in
isotropic 8 chain model with I_4 in anisotropic 8 chain model is physically
corresponding to changing representative 8 chain cubic cell to 8 chain slender
cell. This treatment not only simplifies exist anisotropic mathematical
structures but also keeps microscopic physics of 8 chain model unchanged.

eigenvalue $\lambda$ for operators on graphs. We first show that the maximum of
the landscape function is comparable to the reciprocal of the ground state
eigenvalue if the operator satisfies certain semigroup kernel upper bounds.
This implies general upper and lower bounds on the landscape product
$\lambda\|u\|_\infty$ for several models, including the Anderson model and
random hopping (bond-disordered) models, on graphs that are roughly isometric
to $\mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as on some fractal-like graphs such as the
Sierpinski gasket graph. Next, we specialize to a random hopping model on
$\mathbb{Z}$, and show that as the size of the chain grows, the landscape
product $\lambda\|u\|_\infty$ approaches $\pi^2/8$ for Bernoulli off-diagonal
disorder, and has the same upper bound of $\pi^2/8$ for Uniform([0,1])
off-diagonal disorder. We also numerically study the random hopping model when
the band width (hopping distance) is greater than one, and provide strong
numerical evidence that a similar approximation holds for low-lying energies in
the spectrum.

                                        <span>  Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to
relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$
to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver
$\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an
isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra.
Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded
dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of
Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in
dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of
$\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum
given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and
prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is
obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of
scalars.

automata with nearest-neighbor interaction including the Domany-Kinzel model. A
special case of the Domany-Kinzel model is directed percolation. We regard the
interacting particle system as a Markov chain on a graph. Then we present a new
quantization of the interacting particle system. After that, we introduce a
zeta function of the quantized model and give its determinant expression.
Moreover, we calculate the absolute zeta function of the quantized model for
the Domany-Kinzel model.

                                        <span>  Lloyd Shapley's cooperative value allocation theory stands as a central
concept in game theory, extensively utilized across various domains to
distribute resources, evaluate individual contributions, and ensure fairness.
The Shapley value formula and his four axioms that characterize it form the
foundation of the theory.
  Traditionally, the Shapley value is assigned under the assumption that all
players in a cooperative game will ultimately form the grand coalition. In this
paper, we reinterpret the Shapley value as an expectation of a certain
stochastic path integral, with each path representing a general coalition
formation process. As a result, the value allocation is naturally extended to
all partial coalition states. In addition, we provide a set of five properties
that extend the Shapley axioms and characterize the stochastic path integral.
Finally, by integrating Hodge calculus, stochastic processes, and path
integration of edge flows on graphs, we expand the cooperative value allocation
theory beyond the standard coalition game structure to encompass a broader
range of cooperative network configurations.

                                        <span>  Data assimilation is crucial in a wide range of applications, but it often
faces challenges such as high computational costs due to data dimensionality
and incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms. To address these
challenges, this study presents a novel assimilation framework, termed Latent
Assimilation with Implicit Neural Representations (LAINR). By introducing
Spherical Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) along with a data-driven
uncertainty estimator of the trained neural networks, LAINR enhances efficiency
in assimilation process. Experimental results indicate that LAINR holds certain
advantage over existing methods based on AutoEncoders, both in terms of
accuracy and efficiency.

unifying Minkowski, de Sitter and anti de Sitter Quantum Field Theory. In this
context, we highlight the role of an important class of plane waves which are
either de Sitter or anti de Sitter covariant and are compatible with the
relevant analyticity domains linked to the spectral condition(s). We show again
how to expand the two-point functions and propagators in terms of them and some

                                        <span>  We explore the change in the sign of the Hubble parameter in the early
universe and its stability in higher-order torsion gravity. Our study explores
the various scenarios involving the sub-relativistic universe, radiation
universe, ultra-relativistic universe, dust universe, and stiff fluid universe.
Different analytical methods, including power-law, exponential scalar factor,
and hybrid scale factor methods, are employed to examine the behavior of the
universe about the equation of state (EoS) parameters. This study is based on
the previous ones by presenting a more comprehensive analysis of the bouncing
scenarios within the higher-order torsion gravity framework. It makes
significant progress in reconstructing gravitational Lagrangians, which are
tailored to specific parameter values, allowing for a thorough examination of
the energy conditions necessary for successful bouncing models. These derived
Lagrangians provide analytical solutions for a range of bouncing models,
including symmetric bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory bounce, matter bounce,
and exponential bouncing settings. The presence of exotic matter is responsible
for the accelerated expansion of the universe, as it exhibits substantial
negative pressure. A thorough analysis of torsion-based gravity theories and
the specific investigations into bouncing scenarios set it apart from previous
works exploring alternative gravity theories and their cosmological
consequences. These contributions lie in the comprehensive exploration of
bouncing models and the detailed examination of the energy conditions in
higher-order torsion gravity.

                                        <span>  This work deals with models described by three real scalar fields in one
spatial dimension. We study the case where two of the three fields engender
kinematical modifications, which respond as geometrical constrictions, that can
be used to change the center and/or the tails of the kinklike configurations.
An important advantage of our procedure is the construction of a method for the
obtention of first-order differential equations that solve the equations of
motion and give rise to stable localized structures. We illustrate the general
procedure investigating several distinct examples, and suggesting some
possibilities of applications of practical use, in particular, to the case of
domain walls and skyrmions in magnetic material, collisions of kinks and to
deal with braneworld scenarios having a warped five-dimensional anti de Sitter
geometry, with a single extra dimension of infinite extent.

                                        <span>  We explore non-equilibrium processes in two-dimensional conformal field
theories (2d CFTs) due to the growth of operators induced by inhomogeneous and
homogeneous Hamiltonians by investigating the time dependence of the partition
function, energy density, and entanglement entropy. The non-equilibrium
processes considered in this paper are constructed out of the Lorentzian and
Euclidean time evolution governed by different Hamiltonians. We explore the
effect of the time ordering on entanglement dynamics so that we find that in a
free boson CFT and RCFTs, this time ordering does not affect the entanglement
entropy, while in the holographic CFTs, it does. Our main finding is that in
the holographic CFTs, the non-unitary time evolution induced by the
inhomogeneous Hamiltonian can retain the initial state information longer than
in the unitary time evolution.

                                        <span>  We review recent developments in our understanding of the dynamics of
strongly-coupled chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories in four dimensions, problems
which are potentially important in our quest to go beyond the standard
$SU(3)_{QCD} \times (SU(2) \times U(1))_{GWS}$ model of the fundamental
interactions. The generalized symmetries and associated new 't Hooft
anomaly-matching constraints allow us to exclude, in a wide class of chiral
gauge theories, confining vacuum with full flavor symmetries supported by a set
of color-singlet massless composite fermions. The color-flavor-locked dynamical
Higgs phase, dynamical Abelianization or more general symmetry breaking phase,
appear as plausible IR dynamics, depending on the massless matter fermions
present. We revisit and discuss critically several well-known confinement
criteria in the literature, for both chiral and vectorlike gauge theories, and
propose tentative, new criteria for discriminating different phases. Finally,
we review an idea which might sound rather surprising at first, but is indeed
realized in some softly-broken supersymmetric theories, that confinement in QCD
is a small deformation (in the IR end of the renormalization-group flow) of a
strongly-coupled, nonlocal, nonAbelian conformal fixed point.

                                        <span>  We propose a possible quantum signature of the early Universe that could lead
to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period.
Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in
entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due
to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint
that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured
in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and
inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive
measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order
correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the
intrinsic alignment.

                                        <span>  Given the growing interest in gravitational-wave and cosmological
parity-violating effects in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, it is crucial
to investigate whether the scalar-gravitational Pontryagin term in dCS persists
when formulated in the context of the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$ anomaly
in the Standard Model (SM). In particular, it has been argued that dCS gravity
can be reduced to Einstein gravity after ''rotating away'' the
gravitational-Pontryagin coupling into the phase of the Weinberg operator
$\unicode{x2013}$ analogous to the rotation of the axion zero-mode into the
quark mass matrix. We find that dCS is nontrivial if the scalar field $\phi$
has significant space-time dependence from dynamics. We provide a comprehensive
consideration of the dCS classical and quantum symmetries relevant for
embedding a dCS sector in the SM. We find that, because of the B-L chiral
gravitational anomaly, the scalar-Pontryagin term cannot be absorbed by a field
redefinition. Assuming a minimal extension of the SM, we also find that a
coupling of the dCS scalar with right-handed neutrinos induces both the
scalar-Pontryagin coupling and an axion-like phase in the dimension-five
Weinberg operator. We comment on the issue of gauging the
$\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$, the observational effects with these two
operators present for upcoming experiments, and the origin of dCS gravity in
string theory.

tensor-product wave-function of some few-body clusters. We discuss a type of
symmetry-breaking orders, dubbed entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders,
which cannot be realized by any tensor-product state. Given a symmetry breaking
pattern, we propose a criterion to diagnose if the symmetry-breaking order is
entanglement-enabled, by examining the compatibility between the symmetries and
the tensor-product description. For concreteness, we present an infinite family
of exactly solvable gapped models on one-dimensional lattices with
nearest-neighbor interactions, whose ground states exhibit entanglement-enabled
symmetry-breaking orders from a discrete symmetry breaking. In addition, these
ground states have gapless edge modes protected by the unbroken symmetries. We
also propose a construction to realize entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking
orders with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Under the unbroken
symmetries, some of our examples can be viewed as symmetry-protected
topological states that are beyond the conventional classifications.

                                        <span>  In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium
affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For
the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried
away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a
finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced
matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be
modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and
observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen
number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at
constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal
compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them.
In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the
collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive
the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the
relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction
with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays
an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium.
Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and
thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time
approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said
approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature.
Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the
rotation of the QGP medium.

quintessential $\alpha$-attractor inflation (arXiv: 2305.00230 [gr-qc]) to the
case of quintessential spontaneous baryogenesis and generation of relic
gravitational waves in presence of a rolling scalar field during kination. An
\textit{effective 4-Fermi construct} technique has been employed to compute the
freeze-out temperature and the baryon-to-entropy ratio, of which the obtained
results conform to the experimental requirements for $0.28\leq\alpha\leq 0.30$.
This range of $\alpha$ is found to originate from the functional behaviour of
the end-value expression of the potential concerned. We also find a blue-tilted
gravitational wave spectrum during a transition from inflation to kination. The
amplitudes of the gravitational waves during radiation domination satisfy the
constraint for nucleosynthesis and the characteristic strain of the ongoing
gravitational wave detectors. Thus, the most important observation emerged from
the present study is that, increasingly small fractional values of $\alpha$ are
favourable for unification of inflation, baryogenesis, quintessence and
gravitational waves within a single model. This could have an interesting
connection with the fundamental origin of $\alpha$-attractor.

functions of spinning operators. We show that the correlation functions of
spinning operators in the interacting SBHS theory take a remarkably simple form
and that they can be written just in terms of the free fermionic and critical
bosonic theory correlators. They also interpolate nicely between the results in
these two theories. When expressed in spinor-helicity variables we obtain an
anyonic phase which nicely interpolates between the free fermionic and critical
bosonic results which makes 3D bosonization manifest. Further, we also obtain a
form for five and higher point functions as well by performing a similar
analysis.

                                        <span>  This chapter explains the concept of \emph{Effective String Theories}(EST),
and their success in explaining the results that Yang-Mills flux tubes behave,
to a high degree of accuracy, like Bosonic Strings(BST). It describes EST's of
L\"uscher and Weisz, and their principal conclusions. It then discusses the
Polchinski-Strominger EST's. which are valid in all dimensions. It then
describes the works by Drummond, and, the author and Peter Matlock, which
extended the analysis to $R^{-3}$ order and showed, that even at that order the
spectrum is that of BST. The chapter analyses the issues of string momentum in
higher orders. It discusses at length the powerful covariant calculus, to
systematically construct EST's to arbitrary orders. The most general actions to
$R^{-7}$ order are shown to be governed by just two parameters. The works of
Aharony and collaborators on the spectrum of EST's, both in static and
conformal gauges,to $R^{-5}$ order, and their results that even at that order
the ground state energy remains the same as that of BST, but the excited
spectrum gets corrected for $D\,>\,3$, are explained. It discusses the
simulation results for excited states. It also discusses the AdS-CFT approaches
and thickness of flux tubes.Recent works by Ambjorn, Makeenko, and Sedrakyan on
the path-integral approaches to this issue are also discussed and compared with
the other approaches. It concludes with remarks on the significance of the
results for QCD.

model, created by extending the $\phi^4$ kink in an additional infinite
direction. Classically, the tension is $m^3/3\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the
coupling and $m$ is the meson mass. At order $O(\lambda^0)$ all ultraviolet
divergences can be removed by normal ordering, less trivial divergences arrive
only at the next order. This allows us to easily quantize the domain wall,
working at order $O(\lambda^0)$. We calculate the leading quantum correction to
its tension as a two-dimensional integral over a function which is determined
analytically. This integral is performed numerically, resulting in
$-0.0866m^2$. We also find, at this order, the excitation spectrum.

                                        <span>  Large linear systems play an important role in high-energy theory, appearing
in amplitude bootstraps and during integral reduction. This paper introduces
FiniteFieldSolve, a general-purpose toolkit for exactly solving large linear
systems over the rationals. The solver interfaces directly with Mathematica, is
straightforward to install, and seamlessly replaces Mathematica's native
solvers. In testing, FiniteFieldSolve is approximately two orders of magnitude
faster than Mathematica and uses an order of magnitude less memory. The package
also compares favorably against other public solvers in FiniteFieldSolve's
intended use cases. As the name of the package suggests, solutions are obtained
via well-known finite field methods. These methods suffer from introducing an
inordinate number of modulo (or integer division) operations with respect to
different primes. By automatically recompiling itself for each prime,
FiniteFieldSolve converts the division operations into much faster combinations
of instructions, dramatically improving performance. The technique of compiling
the prime can be applied to any finite field solver, where the time savings
will be solver dependent. The operation of the package is illustrated through a
detailed example of an amplitude bootstrap.

                                        <span>  Intensity interferometry is a technique developed many decades ago, that has
recently enjoyed a renaissance thanks in part to advances in photodetector
technology. We investigate the potential for long-baseline optical intensity
interferometry to observe bright, active galactic nuclei (AGN) associated with
rapidly accreting supermassive black holes. We argue that realistic telescope
arrays similar in area to existing Cherenkov arrays, if equipped with modern
high-precision single photon detectors, can achieve a sufficiently high signal
to noise ratio not only to detect distant AGN, but also to study them in great
detail. We explore the science potential of such observations by considering
two examples. First, we find that intensity interferometric observations of
bright nearby AGN can allow detailed studies of the central accretion disks
powering the AGN, allowing reconstruction of many disk properties like the
radial profile. Next, we argue that intensity interferometers can spatially
resolve the broad-line regions of AGN at cosmological distances, and thereby
provide a geometric determination of the angular diameter distances to those
AGN when combined with reverberation mapping. Since this measurement can be
performed for AGN at distances of hundreds of megaparsecs, this directly
measures the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, with a precision adequate to resolve
the recent Hubble tension. Finally, we speculate on future applications that
would be enabled by even larger intensity interferometer arrays.

the previous ones by presenting a more comprehensive analysis of the bouncing

tailored to specific parameter values, allowing for a thorough examination of
the energy conditions necessary for successful bouncing models. These derived
Lagrangians provide analytical solutions for a range of bouncing models,
including symmetric bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory bounce, matter bounce,
and exponential bouncing settings. The presence of exotic matter is responsible
for the accelerated expansion of the universe, as it exhibits substantial
negative pressure. A thorough analysis of torsion-based gravity theories and
the specific investigations into bouncing scenarios set it apart from previous
works exploring alternative gravity theories and their cosmological
consequences. These contributions lie in the comprehensive exploration of
bouncing models and the detailed examination of the energy conditions in
higher-order torsion gravity.

                                        <span>  The basic aim of this manuscript is to investigate the cosmological solutions
in the context of the modified $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity, where $R$ is the
Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. For our
current work, we consider the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time for finding
the solutions of field equations. We investigate the nature of universe by
considering acceleration expansion of universe, ultra relativistic universe,
sub-relativistic universe, dust universe, radiation universe, stiff universe.
Moreover, we apply the power law technique by taking two different $f(R, T)$
gravity models to observe the expanding nature of the universe. The bouncing
scenario is also discussed by choosing some particular values of the model
parameters and observed the energy conditions, which are satisfied for a
successful bouncing model. It is also concluded that some solutions in $f(R,
T)$ theory of gravity supports the concept of exotic matter and accelerated
expansion of the universe due to a large amount of negative pressure.

                                        <span>  We evaluate the possibility of the formation of naked singularities in the
interaction of Kerr black holes with test massless spin-2 fields. We analyse
the scattering problem for both extremal and nearly extremal black holes by
incorporating the explicit form of the absorption probabilities. We show that
extremal black holes become non-extremal after the interaction with the modes
with both positive and negative absorption probabilities. For nearly extremal
black holes the absorption probability for the challenging modes turns out to
be of the order $\epsilon^5$, where $\epsilon$ parametrizes the closeness to
extremality. This value implies that the event horizon is preserved without the
need to employ the backreaction effects. The result directly follows from the
incorporation of the absorption probabilities into the analysis. We also review
and extend our previous comments on Sorce-Wald method. We show that the order
magnitude problems can be avoided by abandoning the non-physical parameter
$\lambda$. The conditions derived by Sorce-Wald can be legitimately used to
incorporate the back-reaction effects by avoiding to multiply them by
$\lambda^2$, thereby preserving the magnitude of their contribution. We apply
this method to the problems of over-charging R-N black holes and over-spinning
Kerr black holes, in a rough analysis ignoring absorption probabilities which
could apply to test bodies.

                                        <span>  In this work, we investigate the bouncing behavior of the universe within the
framework of $f(R,L_m)$ gravity, using a simple form of
$f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^\gamma$ (where $\gamma$ is a free model parameter) as
previously studied. The model predicts a vanishing Hubble parameter in the
early and late times, with the deceleration parameter approaching a specific
limit at the bouncing point. The EoS parameter is observed to cross the phantom
divide line ($\omega=-1$) near the bouncing point, indicating a significant
transition from a contracting to an expanding phase. The model satisfies the
necessary energy conditions for a successful bouncing scenario, with violations
indicating exotic matter near the bouncing point. Stability conditions are
satisfied for certain values of $\gamma$ near the bouncing point, but potential
instabilities in late-time evolution require further investigation. Finally, we
conclude that the $f(R,L_m)$ gravity model is promising for understanding the
universe's dynamics, especially during events like the bouncing phase.

to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period.
Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in
entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due
to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint
that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured
in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and
inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive
measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order
correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the
intrinsic alignment.

                                        <span>  Given the growing interest in gravitational-wave and cosmological
parity-violating effects in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, it is crucial
to investigate whether the scalar-gravitational Pontryagin term in dCS persists
when formulated in the context of the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$ anomaly
in the Standard Model (SM). In particular, it has been argued that dCS gravity
can be reduced to Einstein gravity after ''rotating away'' the
gravitational-Pontryagin coupling into the phase of the Weinberg operator
$\unicode{x2013}$ analogous to the rotation of the axion zero-mode into the
quark mass matrix. We find that dCS is nontrivial if the scalar field $\phi$
has significant space-time dependence from dynamics. We provide a comprehensive
consideration of the dCS classical and quantum symmetries relevant for
embedding a dCS sector in the SM. We find that, because of the B-L chiral
gravitational anomaly, the scalar-Pontryagin term cannot be absorbed by a field
redefinition. Assuming a minimal extension of the SM, we also find that a
coupling of the dCS scalar with right-handed neutrinos induces both the
scalar-Pontryagin coupling and an axion-like phase in the dimension-five
Weinberg operator. We comment on the issue of gauging the
$\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$, the observational effects with these two
operators present for upcoming experiments, and the origin of dCS gravity in
string theory.

quintessential $\alpha$-attractor inflation (arXiv: 2305.00230 [gr-qc]) to the
case of quintessential spontaneous baryogenesis and generation of relic
gravitational waves in presence of a rolling scalar field during kination. An
\textit{effective 4-Fermi construct} technique has been employed to compute the
freeze-out temperature and the baryon-to-entropy ratio, of which the obtained
results conform to the experimental requirements for $0.28\leq\alpha\leq 0.30$.
This range of $\alpha$ is found to originate from the functional behaviour of
the end-value expression of the potential concerned. We also find a blue-tilted
gravitational wave spectrum during a transition from inflation to kination. The
amplitudes of the gravitational waves during radiation domination satisfy the
constraint for nucleosynthesis and the characteristic strain of the ongoing
gravitational wave detectors. Thus, the most important observation emerged from
the present study is that, increasingly small fractional values of $\alpha$ are
favourable for unification of inflation, baryogenesis, quintessence and
gravitational waves within a single model. This could have an interesting
connection with the fundamental origin of $\alpha$-attractor.

                                        <span>  We investigate the shadow and optical appearance of the hairy
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole illuminated by two toy models of static
accretion. The hairy RN black hole was constructed in the gravitation
decoupling approach to describe the deformation of a Schwarzschild black hole
due to the inclusion of additional arbitrary source (scalar field, tensor
field, fluidlike dark matter, etc). So it is characterized by the parameters:
mass ($M$), deformation factor ($\alpha$), electric charge ($Q$) and the
additional hairy charge ($l_o$), differentiating from the case in RN black
hole. Though the specific background theory that results in this hairy RN black
hole is still tricky, here we shall focus on the novel observable features
introduced by the hair of this black hole. First, we find that for the hairy RN
black hole, the event horizon, radius of photon sphere and critical impact
parameter all increase as the increasings of $Q$ and $l_o$, but decrease as
$\alpha$ grows. The three characterized parameters are found to have
significant effects on the photon trajectories, shadows and images of hairy RN
black hole surrounded by the static accretion disk and spherical accretion,
respectively. Particularly, both $Q$ and $l_o$ have mutually reinforcing
effects on the optical appearance and shadows of the hairy RN black hole, which
implies that we may not distinguish the electric charge and hairy charge from
the shadow and image of black hole in this scenario. Additionally, because of
the competing effects of the charge parameters ($Q, l_o$) and the deviation
parameter $\alpha$ on the observed intensities of brightness, the optical
appearance between the hairy RN black hole and RN black hole could have
degeneracies, indicating the indistinguishability. Our current results
contribute more to the phenomenal aspects which could be helpful to build the
background theory of hairy RN black hole.

precession detected with gravitational waves (GWs) from an individual binary
system. However, this claim warrants a cautious evaluation because the GW event
coincided with a broadband noise disturbance in LIGO Livingston caused by the
45 MHz electro-optic modulator system. In this paper, we present a
state-of-the-art neural network that is able to model and mitigate the
broadband noise from the LIGO Livingston interferometer. We also demonstrate
that our neural network mitigates the noise better than the algorithm used by
the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Finally, we re-analyse GW200129 with the
improved data quality and show that the evidence for precession is still
observed.

                                        <span>  Higgs inflation with a Gauss-Bonnet term is studied in the Einstein frame.
Our model features two coupling functions, $\Omega^2(\phi)$ and $\omega(\phi)$,
coupled to the Ricci scalar and Gauss-Bonnet combinations. We found a special
relation $\Omega^2 \propto \omega$ sets the system a lot more simplified;
therefore, we take it for granted in our analytical studies. As a result of a
Weyl transformation to the Einstein frame, we notice the emergence of new
interactions: a non-minimal kinetic coupling between the scalar field and
gravity and a derivative self-interaction of the scalar field. In the Einstein
frame, we investigate the cosmological implications of these interactions by
deriving the background equation of motion and observable quantities. Our
numerical result on $n_S$ vs. $r$ suggests our model is consistent with the
observational data for a wide range of the model parameter, $-1.4\times
10^4\lesssim \alpha \equiv \frac{\omega}{\Omega^2} \lesssim 8\times 10^3$,
where both the positive and negative values of $\alpha$ are allowed. As the
Gauss-Bonnet contributions decay away with time after inflation, the
propagation speed of gravitational waves turned out to be consistent with the
recent constraints on the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs)
without inducing ghost instability.

develop the Ostrogradsky instability even if a seemingly dangerous mode is
present. Such theories satisfy only partially the degeneracy conditions that
are usually imposed to remove the dangerous mode completely, and are dubbed as
U-DHOST theories. We study weak gravitational fields sourced by nonrelativistic
matter distributions in U-DHOST theories. In contrast to the case of totally
degenerate theories where nonlinear derivative interactions are crucial for
exhibiting the Vainshtein mechanism and its partial breaking, we show that in
generic U-DHOST theories the linear analysis is sufficient for weak
gravitational fields. We identify the subset of U-DHOST theories in which solar
system tests are evaded and gravitational waves propagate at the speed of
light. Such theories can however be tested with cosmological observations. We
also point out that there is a particular case of U-DHOST theories where
nonlinear derivative interactions play an important role as in totally
degenerate theories. In that case, it is found, however, that the Vainshtein
mechanism does not operate and gravitational forces are modified.

                                        <span>  One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any
noticeable observable effects of higher-rank anti-symmetric tensor fields, such
as space-time torsion, in any natural phenomena. Here we address the possible
explanation of torsion, which may often be identified with the field strength
tensor of the second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field. Within the framework
of f(R) gravity, we explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of
freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general higher curvature
model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while the values of different
cosmological parameters follow acceptable values in the framework of standard
cosmology at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity
(i.e. different values of n ), only for Starobinsky model (n = 2), the Kalb
Ramond field gets naturally suppressed with cosmological evolution. In
contrast, for other models (n both positive and negative), despite their
agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar field associated with the higher
derivative degree of freedom induces an enhancement in Kalb-Ramond field and
thereby contradicts the observation. The result does not change even if we
include the Cosmological Constant. Thus our result reveals that among different
$f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of
space-time torsion along with a consistent cosmological evolution.

observational data, we use a general relativistic model that describes black
hole rotation curves and further employ a Bayesian fitting method.
  Results. We estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the aforementioned BHs,
their $x_0$-offset as well as the recessional redshifts of the host galaxies
produced by both peculiar motion and cosmological expansion of the Universe.
Finally, we calculate the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to the BH
for each AGN. This gravitational redshift is a general relativistic effect
produced by the gravitational field of the BH properly included in the
modeling.

                                        <span>  For long wavelength gravitational wave (GW), it is easy to diffract when it
is lensed by celestial objects. Traditional diffractive integral formula has
ignored large angle diffraction, which is adopted in most of cases. However, in
some special cases (e. g. a GW source lensed by a supermassive black hole in a
binary system, where the lens is close to the source), large angle diffraction
could be important. Our previous works have proposed a new general diffractive
integral formula which is also valid for large angle diffraction case. In this
paper, we have investigated how much difference between this general
diffractive formula and traditional diffractive integral formula could be under
these special cases with different parameters. We find that the module of
amplification factor for general diffractive formula could become smaller than
that of traditional diffractive integral basically with a factor
$r_F\simeq0.806$ when the distance between lens and sources is $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$
AU and lens mass $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$. Their difference is so
significant that it is detectable. Furthermore, we find that the
proportionality factor $r_F$ is gradually increasing from 0.5 to 1 with
increasing $D_{\rm LS}$ and it is decreasing with increasing $M_{\rm L}$. As
long as $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim0.2$ AU (with $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$) or
$M_{\rm L}\gtrsim2\times10^6M_\odot$ (with $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU ), the
difference between new and traditional formulas is enough significant to be
detectable. It is promising to test this new general diffractive formula in the
future GW detection.

                                        <span>  This chapter explains the concept of \emph{Effective String Theories}(EST),
and their success in explaining the results that Yang-Mills flux tubes behave,
to a high degree of accuracy, like Bosonic Strings(BST). It describes EST's of
L\"uscher and Weisz, and their principal conclusions. It then discusses the
Polchinski-Strominger EST's. which are valid in all dimensions. It then
describes the works by Drummond, and, the author and Peter Matlock, which
extended the analysis to $R^{-3}$ order and showed, that even at that order the
spectrum is that of BST. The chapter analyses the issues of string momentum in
higher orders. It discusses at length the powerful covariant calculus, to
systematically construct EST's to arbitrary orders. The most general actions to
$R^{-7}$ order are shown to be governed by just two parameters. The works of
Aharony and collaborators on the spectrum of EST's, both in static and
conformal gauges,to $R^{-5}$ order, and their results that even at that order
the ground state energy remains the same as that of BST, but the excited
spectrum gets corrected for $D\,>\,3$, are explained. It discusses the
simulation results for excited states. It also discusses the AdS-CFT approaches
and thickness of flux tubes.Recent works by Ambjorn, Makeenko, and Sedrakyan on
the path-integral approaches to this issue are also discussed and compared with
the other approaches. It concludes with remarks on the significance of the
results for QCD.

hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large
magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with
isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize
the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through
a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between
optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large
gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals
to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of
the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle
experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1
GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at 13.165 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution,
2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit
in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the
image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave
interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We
expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup,
limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a
practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on
electronic heterodyne detection.

finite temperatures showcases the ongoing challenges in understanding complex
quantum systems. Recently, atom number fluctuations in weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensates were observed, motivating an investigation of the
thermal component of partially condensed Bose gases. Here, we present a
combined analysis of both components, revealing the presence of fluctuations in
the thermal component. This analysis includes a comprehensive statistical
evaluation of uncertainties in the preparation and parameter estimation of
partially condensed Bose gases. Using Monte Carlo simulations of optical
density profiles, we estimate the noise contributions to the atom number and
temperature estimation of the condensed and thermal cloud, which is generally
applicable in the field of ultracold atoms. Furthermore, we investigate the
specific noise contributions in the analysis of atom number fluctuations and
show that preparation noise in the total atom number leads to an important
technical noise contribution. Subtracting all known noise contributions from
the variance of the atom number in the BEC and thermal component allows us to
improve the estimate of the fundamental peak fluctuations.

engineering and research applications, and often requires complex bespoke
hardware and software. This paper introduces an AWG framework using an NVIDIA
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed
Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal
computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data parallel additive
waveform synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated
waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG framework is programmed
using the developer-friendly Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) runtime
application programming interface from NVIDIA and is readily customizable, and
scalable with additional parallel hardware. We present and characterize two
different pathways for computing modulated radio-frequency (rf) waveforms: one
pathway offers high-complexity simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual
Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones for 35 ms at a sampling rate of 560
MB/s, and the other pathway allows simultaneous continuous chirping of 194
individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 100 MB/s, or 20 individual
tones at 560 MB/s. This AWG framework is designed for fast on-the-fly
rearrangement of a large stochastically-loaded optical tweezer array of single
atoms or molecules into a defect-free array needed for quantum simulation and
quantum computation applications.

                                        <span>  Ultra-cold atomic systems are among the most promising platforms that have
the potential to shed light on the complex behavior of many-body quantum
systems. One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a
strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite
being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open
questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported
measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective
effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when
looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by
the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis
of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength
and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak
drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system
evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned
dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported
superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative
resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative
differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter
(from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field
treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible
conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains
the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous
effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting
disordered arrays in free space.

nitric oxide (NO) with increasing density of a background gas at room
temperature. As a background gas we either use NO itself or nitrogen (N$_{2}$).
The precision spectroscopy is performed by a sub-Doppler three-photon
excitation scheme with a subsequent readout of the Rydberg states realized by
the amplification of a current generated by free charges due to collisions. The
shift shows a dependence on the rotational quantum state of the ionic core and
no dependence on the principle quantum number of the orbiting Rydberg electron.
The experiment was performed in the context of developing a trace-gas sensor
for breath-gas analysis in a medical application.

laboratories to practical applications in the field, driving the demand for
robust, scalable, and reproducible system integration techniques. Ceramic
components can be pivotal thanks to high stiffness, low thermal expansion, and
excellent dimensional stability under thermal stress. We explore
lithography-based additive manufacturing of technical ceramics especially for
miniaturized physics packages and electro-optical systems. This approach
enables functional systems with precisely manufactured, intricate structures
and high mechanical stability while minimizing size and weight. It facilitates
rapid prototyping, simplifies fabrication and leads to highly integrated,
reliable devices. As an electrical insulator with low outgassing and high
temperature stability, printed technical ceramics such as Al2O3 and AlN bridge
a technology gap in quantum technology and offer advantages over other
printable materials. We demonstrate this potential with CerAMRef, a
micro-integrated rubidium D2 line optical frequency reference on a printed
Al2O3 micro-optical bench and housing. The frequency instability of the
reference is comparable to laboratory setups while the volume of the integrated
spectroscopy setup is only 6 ml. We identify potential for future applications
in compact atomic magnetometers, miniaturized optical atom traps, and vacuum
system integration.

                                        <span>  In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection
of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type
molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state
coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses
technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer
the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train
of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible
transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found
that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with
the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon
detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident
pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced
three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired
population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and,
it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently
transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the
populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.

dissipation and thermal management of electronic and semiconductor devices.
Optical thermoreflective imaging is being used to perform precise temporal and
spatial imaging of heat on wires and semiconductor materials. We apply quantum
squeezed light to perform thermoreflective imaging on micro-wires, surpassing
the shot-noise limit of classical approaches. We obtain a far-field temperature
sensing accuracy of 42 mK after 50 ms of averaging and show that a
$256\times256$ pixel image can be constructed with such sensitivity in 10
minutes. We can further obtain single-shot temperature sensing of 1.6 K after
only 10 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ of averaging enabling dynamical study of heat
dissipation. Not only do the quantum images provide accurate spatio-temporal
information about heat distribution, but the measure of quantum correlation
provides additional information, inaccessible by classical techniques, that can
lead to a better understanding of the dynamics. We apply the technique to both
Al and Nb microwires and discuss the applications of the technique in studying
electron dynamics at low temperatures.

ideal system composed of two harmonic oscillators evolving with a quadratic
Hamiltonian and arbitrarily strong interaction. We solve the dynamics
analytically by employing tools from symplectic geometry. We focus on systems
with initial Gaussian states and quantify exactly the deviation between the
state obtained through the rotating approximation and the state obtained
through the full evolution, therefore providing an answer for all values of the
coupling. We find that the squeezing present in the full Hamiltonian and in the
initial state governs the deviation from the approximated evolution.
Furthermore, we also show that the rotating wave approximation is recovered for
resonant frequencies and vanishing coupling to frequency ratio. Finally, we
give a general proof of the rotating wave approximation and estimate its
convergence on Fock states. Applications and potential physical implementations
are also discussed.

                                        <span>  Validation of quantum advantage claims in the context of Gaussian Boson
Sampling (GBS) currently relies on providing evidence that the experimental
samples genuinely follow their corresponding ground truth, i.e., the
theoretical model of the experiment that includes all the possible losses that
the experimenters can account for. This approach to verification has an
important drawback: it is necessary to assume that the ground truth
distributions are computationally hard to sample, that is, that they are
sufficiently close to the distribution of the ideal, lossless experiment, for
which there is evidence that sampling, either exactly or approximately, is a
computationally hard task. This assumption, which cannot be easily confirmed,
opens the door to classical algorithms that exploit the noise in the ground
truth to efficiently simulate the experiments, thus undermining any quantum
advantage claim. In this work, we argue that one can avoid this issue by
validating GBS implementations using their corresponding ideal distributions
directly. We explain how to use a modified version of the linear cross-entropy,
a measure that we call the LXE score, to find reference values that help us
assess how close a given GBS implementation is to its corresponding ideal
model. Finally, we analytically compute the score that would be obtained by a
lossless GBS implementation.

                                        <span>  Early efforts to realize exotic quantum ground states in frustrated magnets
focused on frustration arising from the lattice geometry alone. Attention has
shifted to bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, as well as further-neighbor
interactions, on non-geometrically-frustrated lattices due to their greater
versatility. The honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ recently emerged as a
candidate host for both bond-dependent (e.g. Kitaev) and third-neighbor ($J_3$)
interactions, and has become a model experimental system due to its relatively
low levels of disorder. Understanding the relative importance of different
exchange interactions holds the key to achieving novel ground states, such as
quantum spin liquids. Here, we use the magnetotropic susceptibility to map out
the intermediate and high-field phase diagram of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ as a
function of the out-of-plane magnetic field direction at $T = 1.6$ K. We show
that the experimental data are qualitatively consistent with classical Monte
Carlo results of the XXZ-$J_1$-$J_3$ model with small Kitaev and off-diagonal
exchange couplings included. However, the calculated critical fields are
systematically larger than the experimental values. Infinite-DMRG computations
on the quantum model reveal that quantum corrections from a nearby
ferromagnetic state are likely responsible for the suppressed critical fields.
Together, our experiment and theory analyses demonstrate that, while quantum
fluctuations play an important role in determining the phase diagram, most of
the physics of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ can be understood in terms of the
classical dynamics of long-range ordered states, leaving little room for the
possibility of a quantum spin liquid.

for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of
residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the
dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of
quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits
are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave
drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent
degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating
frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat
qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on
the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the
conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to
the qubit errors.

distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with minimum error. Previously, a
binary classifier based on classical simulation of the HM has been proposed. It
was observed that using multiple copies of the sample data reduced the
classification error. Nevertheless, the exponential growth in simulation
runtime hindered a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between the
number of copies and classification performance. We present an efficient
simulation method for an arbitrary number of copies by utilizing the
relationship between HM and state fidelity. Our method reveals that the
classification performance does not improve monotonically with the number of
data copies. Instead, it needs to be treated as a hyperparameter subject to
optimization, achievable only through the method proposed in this work. We
present a Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning binary classifier with excellent
performance, providing such empirical evidence by benchmarking on eight
datasets and comparing it with 13 hyperparameter optimized standard
classifiers.

emitter is crucial for photonic quantum information technologies. Recently, the
orbital degree of freedom in optically active semiconductor quantum dots
emerged as a promising candidate. However, the crucial ability to perform
arbitrary rotation on orbital qubits remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate
complete control of hole orbital states in a quantum dot. This is enabled by
successfully inducing stimulated Raman transitions within $\Lambda$ systems
connected via radiative Auger transitions. This new capability allows
manipulations of polar and azimuth angles of the Bloch vector, as evidenced by
Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference, respectively. Simultaneous control
of both parameters is achieved by concurrently varying the amplitude and phase
of picosecond Raman pulses, enabling arbitrary unitary rotation of the Bloch

                                        <span>  Low-energy scattering is well described by the effective-range expansion. In
quantum mechanics, a tower of contact interactions can generate terms in this
expansion after renormalization. Scattering parameters are also encoded in the
self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian. We briefly review this well-known
result for two particles with s-wave interactions using impenetrable
self-adjoint extensions, including the case of harmonically trapped
two-particle states. By contrast, the one-dimensional scattering problem is
surprisingly intricate. We show that the families of self-adjoint extensions
correspond to a coupled system of symmetric and antisymmetric outgoing waves,
which is diagonalized by an SU(2) transformation that accounts for mixing and a
relative phase. This is corroborated by an effective theory computation that
includes all four energy-independent contact interactions. The equivalence of
various one-dimensional contact interactions is discussed and scrutinized from
the perspective of renormalization. As an application, the spectrum of a
general point interaction with a harmonic trap is solved in one dimension.

                                        <span>  The driven Dicke model, wherein an ensemble of atoms is driven by an external
field and undergoes collective spontaneous emission due to coupling to a leaky
cavity mode, is a paradigmatic example of a system exhibiting a
driven-dissipative phase transition as a function of driving strength.
Recently, a similar phenomenon was experimentally observed, not in a cavity
setting, but rather in a free-space atomic ensemble. The reason why similar
behavior should emerge in free space is not obvious, as the system interacts
with a continuum of optical modes, which encodes light propagation effects.
Here, we present and solve a simple model to explain the behavior of the
free-space system, based on the one-dimensional Maxwell-Bloch equations. On one
hand, we show that a free-space ensemble at a low optical depth can exhibit
similar behavior as the cavity system, as spatial propagation effects are
negligible. On the other hand, in the thermodynamic limit of large atom number,
we show that certain observables such as the transmittance or the atomic
excited population exhibit non-analytic behavior as a function of the driving
intensity, reminiscent of a phase transition. However, a closer analysis
reveals that the atomic properties are highly inhomogeneous in space, and based
on this we argue that the free-space system does not undergo a phase transition
but rather a ``phase separation", roughly speaking, between saturated and
unsaturated regions.

time-dependent electric field pulses is considered using the $S$-matrix
approach and reduction formulas. They lead to the development of framework
based on the solutions of the Dirac equation with the Feynman- or anti-Feynman
boundary conditions. Their asymptotic properties are linked to the
spin-resolved probability amplitudes of created pairs. The same concerns the
helicity-resolved amplitudes. Most importantly, the aforementioned spin- or
helicity-resolved amplitudes, when summed over spin or helicity configurations,
reproduce the momentum distributions of created particles calculated with other
methods that are typically used in this context. This does validate the current
approach. It also allows us to investigate the vortex structures in momentum
distributions of produced particles, as the method provides an access to the
phase of the probability amplitude. As we also illustrate numerically, the
method is applicable to arbitrary time-dependent electric fields with, in
general, elliptical polarization. This proves its great flexibility.

closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The
mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding
emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not
negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective
resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the
number of emitters from the sample. The 2N lateral spectral-bands,
symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the
central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole
coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This
way, one can extract the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of
the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum.
Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the
cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum
turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two lateral spectral
lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength,
respectively.

                                        <span>  We consider the question: Is it possible to measure two temperatures
simultaneously using a single thermometer? Under common circumstances, where
the thermometer can interact with only one bath at a time and the interaction
leads to complete thermalization, this is clearly impossible because the final
state of the thermometer would be independent of the temperature of the first
bath. In this work, we show that this task can indeed be accomplished with the
assistance of quantum control. In particular, we consider a composite particle
with multiple quantum degrees of freedom (DoF) as a temperature sensor, where
one of the DoF -- termed as internal DoF -- is susceptible to the local
temperature, thereby functioning as a thermometer, whereas another DoF --
termed external DoF -- is quantum-controlled. We leverage the entanglement
between the aforementioned DoF in a composite particle for two-temperature
thermometry by preparing the external DoF in a quantum superposition, exposing
the internal DoF to two local temperatures. We show that such a particle used
in a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer, or a quantum switch -- which allows
quantum control over the order of application of quantum channels -- can be
used to estimate two temperatures simultaneously, thus affirming our main
proposition. For each of these setups, we obtain the variance in the estimated
temperatures through the multi-parameter Cram\'er-Rao bound, and compare their
performances based on the range of total variance of the two temperatures
estimated. On benchmarking all the setups based on the total variance of the
estimated temperatures, we find that a quantum switch with a qudit probe
outperforms other setups. On restricting our probe to be a qubit, we find that
quantum switch performs equally well as a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer.

                                        <span>  The qubit scalability imposes a paramount challenge in the field of quantum
computing. Photonic interconnects between distinct quantum computing modules
provide a solution to deal with this issue. The fundamental part of this
approach is entanglement distribution via travelling photons emitted by matter
qubits. However, randomness of the spontaneous emission in the matter qubits
limits both the entanglement fidelity and the generation rate. In this paper,
by numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the relationship between
the entanglement affected by the spontaneous emission and the waveform of the
pump pulse used in the photon generation. We confirm and analyze a
rate-fidelity trade-off in the entanglement swapping with Gaussian pump pulses
and show that a simple extension to non-Gaussian pump pulses improves the
trade-off in a certain parameter region. Furthermore we extend our analysis to
entanglement distribution in the general multipartite setting and show that the
analysis of the bipartite entanglement can be straightforwardly applied in this
case as well.

loop currents called, `` spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. We
calculate magnetic fields produced by them for a model of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin films composed of one surface
and two bulk CuO$_2$ bilayers. In this model, bulk CuO$_2$ layers host stable
spin-vortices around small polarons formed from doped holes; they give rise to
a $U(1)$ gauge field described by the Berry connection from many-body wave
functions, and generates the SVILCs. The effect of the gauge field is taken
into account by the particle-number conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes (PNC-BdG)
formalism. The magnitude of the calculated magnetic field produced by the
SVILCs in the vicinity of the surface ($10a \approx 4$ nm, where $a$ is the
lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) is in the order of mT; thus, may be
detectable by currently available detection methods. The detection of the
SVILCs by the magnetic field measurement may bring about the elucidation of the
cuprate superconductivity, and may also lead to their quantum device
applications, including qubits.

necessitating higher-order cumulant expansions. We exemplify this using cat
states for which the mean field fails to predict a phase transition but the
second order cumulant expansion theory captures it. Motivated by the symmetries
of the system, we choose a truncation of cumulant theory at the second-order

                                        <span>  We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with
hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large
magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with
isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize
the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through
a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between
optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large
gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals
to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of
the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle
experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1
GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at 13.165 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution,
2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit
in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the
image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave
interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We
expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup,
limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a
practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on
electronic heterodyne detection.

unveil that the long-time average of the spread complexity $\overline{C}_{K}$
can probe the dynamical transition from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation.
When the parameter $\omega$ increases over a critical value $\omega_c$, we
reveal that the spread complexity exhibits a sharp transition from lower to
higher value, with the corresponding phase space trajectory changing from
self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. Moreover, we scrutinize the
eigen-spectrum and uncover the relation between the dynamical transition and
the excited state quantum phase transition, which is characterized by the
emergence of singularity in the density of states at critical energy $E_{c}$.
In the thermodynamical limit, the cross point of $E_{c}(\omega)$ and the
initial energy $E_{0}(\omega)$ determines the dynamical transition point
$\omega_c$. Finally, we show that the different dynamical behavior for the
initial state at a fixed point can be distinguished by the long-time average of
the spread complexity, when the fixed point changes from unstable to stable.

imaginarity of quantum theory has been quantified as a resource with
applications in discrimination tasks, pseudorandomness generation, and quantum
metrology. Here we propose witnesses for imaginarity that are
basis-independent, relying on measurements of unitary-invariant properties of
sets of states. For 3 pure states, we completely characterize the invariant
values attainable by quantum theory, and give a partial characterization for 4
pure states. We show that simple pairwise overlap measurements suffice to
witness imaginarity of sets of 4 states, but not for sets of 3. Our witnesses
are experimentally friendly, opening up a new path for measuring and using
imaginarity as a resource.

                                        <span>  Variational quantum algorithms are gaining attention as an early application
of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the main problems of
variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the
optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the
quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this
problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In
this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is
introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with
$C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against
two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the
geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical
equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for
the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ
devices.

                                        <span>  Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention
because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few
years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much
smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in
the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time,
realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics
principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known
industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the
device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure
as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and
unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected:
the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and
read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are
physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility
substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our
work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic
applications.

                                        <span>  Quantum metrology offers superior measurement precision compared to classical
counterparts. Traditionally, achieving this enhancement involves employing
multi-particle entangled quantum states, necessitating state preparation and
detection schemes that are practically challenging. In this article, we present
a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic parameter estimation that
leverages two state-transfer operations on a single bosonic mode. Specifically,
we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase and amplitude estimation
using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum
electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low photon numbers of up to 1.76, we
achieve quantum-enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching
a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB and 9.3(5) dB respectively for phase and
amplitude estimation. We show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further
enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states based on specific system
constraints. Our protocol can be adapted to further optimize the desired
figures of merit using tailored quantum states or operations, not only for
bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to other continuous-variable
platforms. The realisation of this versatile and effective scheme affords a
promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced sensing.

                                        <span>  In the work of Phys. Rev. A 100, 042710 (2019), it was argued that the
general description of two-body Feshbach resonances requires "closed-channel
parameters" related to the bare bound state causing the resonance. The present
work shows that once the resonance theory is renormalised (i.e. its parameters
are expressed in terms of physical observables) the dependence of two-body
observables on the closed-channel parameters disappears when the inter-channel
coupling is localised in a region where the wave functions are energy
independent. In such a regime, the resulting quantum defect theory is
surprisingly independent of the bare bound state energy. This result highlights
a qualitative difference between resonances in this regime, such as magnetic
resonances in ultracold atoms, and other kinds of resonances, such as hadron
resonances. Although the closed-channel parameters of magnetic resonances do
not affect two-body observables, it is suggested that they could be evidenced
experimentally from short-distance probing and three-body observables.

a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in
perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting
of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a
perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the
eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer
nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a
broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on
this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding
low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and
computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new
possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the
dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel
insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body
systems.

propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a
reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand
the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in
time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the
correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density
functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density
possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has
not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving
method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests
on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large
time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density
matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our
results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the
$4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our
calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of
electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This
calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix
is constant and equals the number of electrons.

                                        <span>  In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple
technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to
process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic
cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain,
that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A
qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for
quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through
this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand,
providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating
entanglement measures and witnesses proving that bipartite and multipartite
entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.

harnesses quantum correlation within entangled photon pairs. A message written
by acting on one of the photons can be read by exclusive measurements of the
other photon of the pair. In this scheme a bright, meaningless optical beam
hides the message rendering it inaccessible to potential eavesdroppers. Unlike
traditional methods our approach only affects unauthorized users, fundamentally
limiting their access to the communication channel. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our protocol by achieving secure communication through both
amplitude and phase modulation. We successfully employ this technique for the
secure transfer of an image. We demonstrate data exchange speed of up to 8 bits
per second, along with the corresponding eye diagrams.

                                        <span>  Ultra-cold atomic systems are among the most promising platforms that have
the potential to shed light on the complex behavior of many-body quantum
systems. One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a
strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite
being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open
questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported
measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective
effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when
looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by
the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis
of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength
and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak
drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system
evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned
dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported
superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative
resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative
differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter
(from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field
treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible
conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains
the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous
effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting
disordered arrays in free space.

covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's
wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions
the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove
that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a
physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis
is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are
consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a
Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the
Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.

                                        <span>  Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose
quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their
applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In
this work, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder,
free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties.
These emerge from massively degenerate eigenspaces where the notion of standard
bipartite entanglement entropy needs to be revisited. We show that
appropriately defined entanglement measures can capture both geometrical
aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. Using a
variety of toy models, we uncover the rich phenomenology of this physics. We
further show that there are decipherable signatures of the classical
percolation transition in these entanglement properties. Our work presents an
interesting interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and
quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.

                                        <span>  Variational quantum algorithms have become the de facto model for current
quantum computations. A prominent example of such algorithms -- the quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- was originally designed for
combinatorial optimization tasks, but has been shown to be successful for a
variety of other problems. However, for most of these problems the optimal
circuit depth remains unknown. One such problem is unstructured search which
consists on finding a particular bit string, or equivalently, preparing a state
of high overlap with a target state. To bound the optimal QAOA depth for such
problem we build on its known solution in a continuous time quantum walk
(CTQW). We trotterize a CTQW to recover a QAOA sequence, and employ recent
advances on the theory of Trotter formulas to bound the query complexity
(circuit depth) needed to prepare a state of almost perfect overlap with the
target state. The obtained complexity exceeds the Grover's algorithm complexity
$O\left(N^\frac{1}{2}\right)$, but remains smaller than $O
\left(N^{\frac{1}{2}+c}\right)$ for any $c>0$, which shows quantum advantage of
QAOA over classical solutions. We verify our analytical predictions by
numerical simulations of up to 68 qubits, which demonstrate that our result
overestimates the number of QAOA layers resulting from a trotterized CTQW by at
most a polynomial factor.

                                        <span>  Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source
has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast
with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics
is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a
key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum,
conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the
probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of
such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno
effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a
good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is
the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not
possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant
times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior
is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative
calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes
that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance
dilaton production in a medium.

                                        <span>  In his book \textit{The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics},
published in 1932, J. von Neumann performed an analysis of the consequences of
introducing hidden parameters (hidden variables) into quantum mechanics. He
showed that hidden variables cannot be incorporated into the existing theory of
quantum mechanics without major modifications, and concluded that if they did
exist, the theory would have already failed in situations where it has been
successfully applied. von Neumann left open the possibility that the theory is
not complete, and his analysis for internal consistency is the best that can be
done for a self-referenced logical system (G\"odel's theorem). This analysis
had been taken as an ``incorrect proof" against the existence of hidden
variables. von Neumann's so-called proof isn't even wrong as such a proof does
not exist. One of the earliest attempts at a hidden variable theory was by D.
Bohm, and because there were no experimental consequences, W. Pauli referred to
it as an ``uncashable check." To our knowledge, a successful hidden variable
extension to quantum mechanics with testable consequences has not yet been
produced, suggesting that von Neumann's analysis is worthy of rehabilitation,
which we attempt to provide in a straightforward manner.

                                        <span>  Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single
part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum
information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascu\'es et al, NJP 10,7,073013
(2008)], known as the NPA hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial
optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent
hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite
programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network
correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum
systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several
generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the Scalar Extension
[Pozas-Kerstjens et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced
while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new
hierarchy, prove its equivalence to the Scalar Extension, and characterise its
convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario, and
explore its relations with the known generalisations.

$|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a harmonic mode, offer a promising route towards quantum
error correction. Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of
the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is
possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the
bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number $|\alpha|^2$. Large
two-photon dissipation rate $\kappa_2$ ensures fast qubit manipulation and
short error correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining
phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here we introduce and
operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode
containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that
of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump and
reaches a rate $\kappa_2/2\pi\approx 2~\mathrm{MHz}$. With such a strong
two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are
prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3~s with only a mild impact on
phase-flip errors. Besides, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum
superposition between $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|-\alpha\rangle$ can be arbitrarily
changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation
active.

of robust quantum advantage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computation, we
propose a scheme to achieve a provable superpolynomial quantum advantage (under
some widely accepted complexity conjectures) that is robust to noise with
minimal error correction requirements. We choose a class of sampling problems
with commuting gates known as sparse IQP (Instantaneous Quantum
Polynomial-time) circuits and we ensure its fault-tolerant implementation by
introducing the tetrahelix code. This new code is obtained by merging several
tetrahedral codes (3D color codes) and has the following properties: each
sparse IQP gate admits a transversal implementation, and the depth of the
logical circuit can be traded for its width. Combining those, we obtain a
depth-1 implementation of any sparse IQP circuit up to the preparation of
encoded states. This comes at the cost of a space overhead which is only
polylogarithmic in the width of the original circuit. We furthermore show that
the state preparation can also be performed in constant depth with a single
step of feed-forward from classical computation. Our construction thus exhibits
a robust superpolynomial quantum advantage for a sampling problem implemented
on a constant depth circuit with a single round of measurement and
feed-forward.

into quantum walks (QWs) and quantum annealing (QA) beyond the adiabatic
theorem. By representing the eigenspace of the problem Hamiltonian as a
hypercube graph, we demonstrate that probability amplitude traverses the search
space through a series of local Rabi oscillations. We argue that the amplitude
movement can be systematically guided towards the ground state using a
time-dependent hopping rate based solely on the problem's energy spectrum.
Building upon these insights, we extend the concept of multi-stage QW by
introducing the guided quantum walk (GQW) as a bridge between QW-like and
QA-like procedures. We assess the performance of the GQW on exact cover,
traveling salesperson and garden optimization problems with 9 to 30 qubits. Our
results provide evidence for the existence of optimal annealing schedules,
beyond the requirement of adiabatic time evolutions. These schedules might be
capable of solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems within
evolution times that scale linearly in the problem size.

reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in
interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the
spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump
together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson
number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a
provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The
results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide
the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.

                                        <span>  We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state,
focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the
quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state
simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the
generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the
problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which
depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry
and is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the
formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, finding
that Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone
(FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state,
there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous
time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare
realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they
conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved
Floquet charge. Nevertheless, these also admit a thermodynamic description in
terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with
respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular
realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$
and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the
Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which
are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long
times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on
these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the
temporal FNG mode of the CES state.

                                        <span>  We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of $c$-coloring
$\chi$-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms, for a wide range of models
of distributed computing. In particular, we show that these problems do not
admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that: 1) We give a new
distributed algorithm that finds a $c$-coloring in $\chi$-chromatic graphs in
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds, with $\alpha =
\bigl\lfloor\frac{c-1}{\chi - 1}\bigr\rfloor$. 2) We prove that any distributed
algorithm for this problem requires $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds.
  Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the
near-matching lower bound holds in the non-signaling model. This model,
introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of
distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not
only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL,
even with a pre-shared quantum state.
  We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g.,
3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-coloring trees remain hard problems even
for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum
advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no
background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs.

isolated from its environment. It has been predicted that this isolation leads
to very low mechanical dissipation rates. However, a gap persists between
predictions and experimental data. Here, we levitate a silica nanoparticle in a
linear Paul trap at room temperature, at pressures as low as $7\times10^{-11}$
mbar. We measure a dissipation rate of $2\pi\times69(22)$ nHz, corresponding to
a quality factor exceeding $10^{10}$, more than two orders of magnitude higher
than previously shown. A study of the pressure dependence of the particle's
damping and heating rates provides insight into the relevant dissipation
mechanisms.

two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent
Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene
nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected
topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and
time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism,
the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An
analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological
charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the
ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears
as a nearly zero-energy edge mode. Our system is outside the conventional
calssification for topological insulators.

for various quantum information and technology applications. Derivations of
most master equations (MEs) for the dynamics of open systems require
approximations that mask dependence of the system dynamics on correlations,
since the MEs focus on reduced system dynamics. Here we demonstrate that the
most common MEs indeed contain hidden information about explicit
system-environment correlation. We unfold these correlations by recasting the
MEs into a universal form in which the system-bath correlation operator
appears. The equations include the Lindblad, Redfield, second-order
time-convolutionless, second-order Nakajima-Zwanzig, and second-order universal
Lindblad-like cases. We further illustrate our results in an example, which
implies that the second-order universal Lindblad-like equation captures
correlation more accurately than other standard techniques.

unique phenomenon acknowledged as a valuable resource. Focusing on a novel
application, we demonstrate its quantum advantage for mobile agents engaged in
specific distributed tasks without communication. The research addresses the
significant challenge of rendezvous on graphs and introduces a new distributed
task for mobile agents grounded in the graph domination problem. Through an
investigation across various graph scenarios, we showcase the quantum
advantage. Additionally, we scrutinize deterministic strategies, highlighting
their comparatively lower efficiency compared to quantum strategies. The paper
concludes with a numerical analysis, providing further insights into our
findings.

                                        <span>  We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve
optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that
present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms.
Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat
bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic
damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state
that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically
prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the
average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit
with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically,
we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins
to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the
impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD
with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent
QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be
theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also
outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization
algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.

                                        <span>  Quantum computers are increasing in size and quality, but are still very
noisy. Error mitigation extends the size of the quantum circuits that noisy
devices can meaningfully execute. However, state-of-the-art error mitigation
methods are hard to implement and the limited qubit connectivity in
superconducting qubit devices restricts most applications to the hardware's
native topology. Here we show a quantum approximate optimization algorithm
(QAOA) on non-planar random regular graphs with up to 40 nodes enabled by a
machine learning-based error mitigation. We use a swap network with careful
decision-variable-to-qubit mapping and a feed-forward neural network to
demonstrate optimization of a depth-two QAOA on up to 40 qubits. We observe a
meaningful parameter optimization for the largest graph which requires running
quantum circuits with 958 two-qubit gates. Our work emphasizes the need to
mitigate samples, and not only expectation values, in quantum approximate
optimization. These results are a step towards executing quantum approximate
optimization at a scale that is not classically simulable. Reaching such system
sizes is key to properly understanding the true potential of heuristic
algorithms like QAOA.

                                        <span>  Measuring properties of quantum systems is a fundamental problem in quantum
mechanics. We provide a simple method for estimating the expectation value of
observables with an unknown quantum state. The idea is to use a data structure
to sample the terms of observables based on the Pauli decomposition
proportionally to their importance. We call this technique operator shadow as a
shorthand for the procedure of preparing a sketch of an operator to estimate
properties. Only when the numbers of observables are small for multiple local
observables, the sample complexity of this method is better than the classical
shadow technique. However, if we want to estimate the expectation value of a
linear combination of local observables, for example the energy of a local
Hamiltonian, the sample complexity is better on all parameters. The time
complexity to construct the data structure is $2^{O(k)}$ for $k$-local
observables, similar to the post-processing time of classical shadows.

                                        <span>  In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection
of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type
molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state
coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses
technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer
the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train
of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible
transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found
that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with
the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon
detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident
pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced
three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired
population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and,
it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently
transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the
populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.

                                        <span>  The effects of squeezed photons and thermal photons on the entanglement
dynamics of atom-atom, atom-field and field-field subsystems are studied for
the double Jaynes-Cummings model. For this purpose, squeezed coherent states
and Glauber-Lachs states of radiation are chosen as field states. For the
atomic states, we choose one of the Bell state as pure state and a Werner-type
state as mixed state. Werner-type state is used to understand the effects of
mixedness on entanglement. To measure the entanglement between the two atoms,
Wootters' concurrence is used; whereas for the atom-field and field-field
subsystems, negativity is chosen. The squeezed photons and thermal photons
create, destroy and transfer entanglement within various subsystems. Also, the
addition of squeezed photons and thermal photons either lengthens or shortens
the duration of entanglement sudden deaths (ESD) associated with atom-atom,
atom-field and field-field entanglement dynamics in a complementary way. The
effects of Ising-type interaction, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity on the
entanglement dynamics are studied. Each of these interactions removes the ESDs
associated with various subsystems. We show that new entanglements are created
in this atom-field system by introducing Ising-type interaction between the two
atoms. With proper choice of the parameters corresponding to Ising-type
interaction, detuning and Kerr-nonliearity, entanglement can be transferred
among various subsystems.

problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector
snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of
subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium
article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector
continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts,
discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent

                                        <span>  Systems subject to high-frequency driving exhibit Floquet prethermalization,
that is, they heat exponentially slowly on a time scale that is large in the
drive frequency, $\tau_{\rm h} \sim \exp(\omega)$. Nonetheless, local
observables can decay much faster via energy conserving processes, which are
expected to cause a rapid decay in the fidelity of an initial state. Here we
show instead that the fidelities of eigenstates of the time-averaged
Hamiltonian, $H_0$, display an exponentially long lifetime over a wide range of
frequencies -- even as generic initial states decay rapidly. When $H_0$ has
quantum scars, or highly excited-eigenstates of low entanglement, this leads to
long-lived non-thermal behavior of local observables in certain initial states.
We present a two-channel theory describing the fidelity decay time $\tau_{\rm
f}$: the interzone channel causes fidelity decay through energy absorption i.e.
coupling across Floquet zones, and ties $\tau_{\rm f}$ to the slow heating time
scale, while the intrazone channel causes hybridization between states in the
same Floquet zone. Our work informs the robustness of experimental approaches
for using Floquet engineering to generate interesting many-body Hamiltonians,
with and without scars.

                                        <span>  We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D)
topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that
the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological
order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground
state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence,
previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is
more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out"
anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons
generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric
under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking
connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem
codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders.
Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a
classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and
even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered
states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a
partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.

from quantum experiments at two times and any number of qubits. We define an
arrow of time inference problem. We consider conditions on the initial and
final states that are symmetric or asymmetric under time reversal. We represent
the spatiotemporal measurement data via the pseudo density matrix space-time
state. There is a forward process which is CPTP and a reverse process which is
obtained via a novel recovery map based on inverting unitary dilations. For
asymmetric conditions, the protocol determines whether the data is consistent
with the unitary dilation recovery map or the CPTP map. For symmetric
conditions, the recovery map yields a valid CPTP map and the experiment may
have taken place in either direction. We also discuss adapting the approach to
the Leifer-Spekkens or Process matrix space-time states.

Proc. R. Soc. A 473, 20170494), is a striking example of a model with
long-range isotropic interactions whose ground states break rotational
symmetry. In this work we analyze and explain the nature of this symmetry
breaking with emphasis on the importance of dimensionality. Interestingly,
rotational symmetry is recovered in three dimensions for small jumps, which
correspond to the non-isotropic cogwheel regime of the two-dimensional problem.
We discuss simplified models that reproduce the symmetry properties of the
original system in N dimensions. For the full grasshopper model in two
dimensions we obtain quantitative predictions for optimal perturbations of the
disk. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

equalization of passive linear quantum systems to help mitigate degrading
effects of quantum communication channels. For such systems, which include a
wide range of linear quantum optical devices and signals, we seek to find a
near optimal equalizing filter which is itself a passive quantum system. The
problem amounts to solving an optimization problem subject to constraints
dictated by the requirement for the equalizer to be physically realizable. By
formulating these constraints in the frequency domain, we show that the problem
admits a convex $H_\infty$-like formulation. This allows us to derive a set of
suboptimal coherent equalizers using $J$-spectral factorization. An additional
semidefinite relaxation combined with the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation is
shown to lead to a tractable algorithm for the design of a near optimal
coherent equalizer.

                                        <span>  Reducing control complexity is essential for achieving large-scale quantum
computing. However, reducing control knobs may compromise the ability to
independently address each qubit. Recent progress in neutral atom-based
platforms suggests that rectangular (row-column) addressing may strike a
balance between control granularity and flexibility for 2D qubit arrays. This
scheme allows addressing qubits on the intersections of a set of rows and
columns each time. While quadratically reducing controls, it may necessitate
more depth. We formulate the depth-optimal rectangular addressing problem as
exact binary matrix factorization, an NP-hard problem also appearing in
communication complexity and combinatorial optimization. We introduce a
satisfiability modulo theories-based solver for this problem, and a heuristic,
row packing, performing close to the optimal solver on various benchmarks.
Furthermore, we discuss rectangular addressing in the context of fault-tolerant
quantum computing, leveraging a natural two-level structure.

one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. We first review the weakly chaotic dynamics
and the consequent early-time anomalous diffusion in the system. The anomalous
diffusion is robust, appears with strictly quantized coefficients, and persists
even for very long chains (more than hundred sites), crossing over to normal
diffusion at late times. We identify fast (angle) and slow (action) variables
and thus consider annealed and quenched partition functions, corresponding to
fixing the actions and integrating over the actions, respectively. We observe
the leading quantum effects in the annealed free energy, whereas the quenched
energy is undefined in the thermodynamic limit, signaling the absence of
thermodynamic equilibrium in the quenched regime. But already the leading
correction away from the quenched regime reproduces the annealed partition
function exactly. This encapsulates the fact that in both slow- and fast-chaos
regime both the anomalous and the normal diffusion can be seen (though at
different times).

system by exploiting the so-called Duffing nonlinearity. Our model system
consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, both driven by an
optical field. One resonator supports Duffing nonlinearity, while the other
does not. The resonators are coupled to each other via the so-called phonon
hopping mechanism. The hopping rate is $\theta$-phase-dependent that induces
Exceptional Points (EPs) singularities in the system. Interestingly, while the
resonator with Duffing nonlinearity exhibits vanishing bipartite entanglement,
we observe an entanglement transfer phenomenon into the other mechanical
resonator. This nonlinearly induced entanglement demonstrates superior
robustness against thermal fluctuations compared to entanglement generated
without the nonlinearity. Additionally, this entanglement features the sudden
death and revival phenomenon, where the peaks happen at the multiple of
$\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$. This work opens a new avenue for exploiting nonlinear
resources to generate robust quantum entanglement, paving the way for
advancements in quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum
computing within complex systems.

coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at
the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in
samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic
exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM), we highlight significant interfacial differences introduced
by ion-milling. The observations suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling
in YIG/Py bilayers is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange
coupling mechanism on the tetrahedral Fe terminated YIG surface, which is
supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research
provides critical insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing the
efficiency of coupling in magnetic bilayers and underscores the pivotal role of

quantum devices to the sizes required for fault-tolerant (FT) quantum
applications. To mitigate the resource overhead caused by fabrication errors,
we combine two approaches: (1) leveraging the flexibility of a modular
architecture, (2) adapting the procedure of quantum error correction (QEC) to
account for fabrication defects. We simulate the surface code adapted to qubit
arrays with arbitrarily distributed defects to find metrics that characterize
how defects affect fidelity. We then determine the impact of defects on the
resource overhead of realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer, on a
chiplet-based modular architecture. Our strategy for dealing with fabrication
defects demonstrates an exponential suppression of logical failure where error
rates of non-faulty physical qubits are ~0.1% in a circuit-based noise model.
This is a typical regime where we imagine running the defect-free surface code.
We use our numerical results to establish post-selection criteria for building
a device from defective chiplets. Using our criteria, we then evaluate the
resource overhead in terms of the average number of fabricated physical qubits
per logical qubit. We find that an optimal choice of chiplet size, based on the
defect rate and target fidelity, is essential to limiting any additional error
correction overhead due to defects. When the optimal chiplet size is chosen, at
a defect rate of 1% the resource overhead can be reduced to below 3X and 6X
respectively for the two defect models we use, for a wide range of target
performance. We also determine cutoff fidelity values that help identify
whether a qubit should be disabled or kept as part of the error correction
code.

the way for efficient adaptations of 1D tensor network algorithms to 2D
fermionic systems. As the first application of this formalism, we developed and
benchmarked a time-evolution block-decimation (TEBD) algorithm for real-time

ground-state energies for gapped systems, systems with a Dirac point, and
systems with gapless edge modes to good accuracy. The real-time TEBD captures
the scattering of two fermions and the chiral edge dynamics on the boundary of

either localization or delocalization, depending on the potential and on the

                                        <span>  The Hadamard well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with
power nonlinearity formulated on the spatial quarter-plane is established in a
low-regularity setting with Sobolev initial data and Dirichlet boundary data in
appropriate Bourgain-type spaces. As both of the spatial variables are
restricted to the half-line, a different approach is needed than the one
previously used for the well-posedness of other initial-boundary value
problems. In particular, now the solution of the forced linear initial-boundary
problem is estimated \textit{directly}, both in Sobolev spaces and in
Strichartz-type spaces, i.e. without a linear decomposition that would require
estimates for the associated homogeneous and nonhomogeneous initial value
problems. In the process of deriving the linear estimates, the function spaces
for the boundary data are identified as the intersections of certain modified
Bourgain-type spaces that involve spatial half-line Fourier transforms instead
of the usual whole-line Fourier transform found in the definition of the
standard Bourgain space associated with the one-dimensional initial value
problem. The fact that the quarter-plane has a corner at the origin poses an
additional challenge, as it requires one to expand the validity of certain
Sobolev extension results to the case of a domain with a non-smooth (Lipschitz)
and non-compact boundary.

highlighting specific features in both 2D systems, such as thin films or curved
surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism
within confined geometries, the contributions from both volume and surface must
be considered, requiring appropriate topological analysis to obtain a complete
view of the system. Here, we consider domain walls in cylindrical magnetic
nanowires to illustrate the use of topological invariants. We begin with
micromagnetic simulations of domain wall transformation under the stimulus of
an \OErsted field, tracking bulk and surface topological signatures, and
analyzing the interplay between multiple micromagnetic objects. For instance,
the extensive analysis allowed us to highlight mechanisms of domain wall type
conversion from topologically non-trivial to trivial states, a phenomenon
disregarded in previous studies. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence
of the transient states predicted to occur during the dynamical process.

distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with minimum error. Previously, a
binary classifier based on classical simulation of the HM has been proposed. It
was observed that using multiple copies of the sample data reduced the
classification error. Nevertheless, the exponential growth in simulation
runtime hindered a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between the
number of copies and classification performance. We present an efficient
simulation method for an arbitrary number of copies by utilizing the
relationship between HM and state fidelity. Our method reveals that the
classification performance does not improve monotonically with the number of
data copies. Instead, it needs to be treated as a hyperparameter subject to
optimization, achievable only through the method proposed in this work. We
present a Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning binary classifier with excellent
performance, providing such empirical evidence by benchmarking on eight
datasets and comparing it with 13 hyperparameter optimized standard
classifiers.

large-scale behaviour of critical and super-critical non-linear stochastic
PDEs, that fall outside the realm of the theory of Regularity Structures. These
include the two-dimensional Anisotropic KPZ equation, the stochastic Burgers
equation in dimension $d\ge 2$ and the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with
divergence-free noise in dimension $d=2$. Rather than providing complete
proofs, we try to emphasise the main ideas, and some crucial aspects of our
approach: the role of the generator equation and of the Fluctuation-Dissipation
Theorem to identify the limit process; Wiener chaos decomposition with respect
to the stationary measure and its truncation; and the so-called Replacement
Lemma, which controls the weak coupling limit of the equations in the critical
dimension and identifies the limiting diffusivity. For pedagogical reasons, we
will focus exclusively on the stochastic Burgers equation. The notes are based
on works in collaboration with Dirk Erhard and Massimiliano Gubinelli.

                                        <span>  This paper discusses the theory and numerical method of two-scale analysis
for the multiscale Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in composite ferromagnetic
materials. The novelty of this work can be summarized in three aspects:
Firstly, the more realistic and complex model is considered, including the
effects of the exchange field, anisotropy field, stray field, and external
magnetic field. The explicit convergence orders in the $H^1$ norm between the
classical solution and the two-scale solution are obtained. Secondly, we
propose a robust numerical framework, which is employed in several
comprehensive experiments to validate the convergence results for the Periodic
and Neumann problems. Thirdly, we design an improved implicit numerical scheme
to reduce the required number of iterations and relaxes the constraints on the
time step size, which can significantly improve computational efficiency.
Specifically, the projection and the expansion methods are given to overcome
the inherent non-consistency in the initial data between the multiscale problem
and homogenized problem.

                                        <span>  Given an affine Poisson algebra, that is singular one may ask whether there
is an associated symplectic form. In the smooth case the answer is obvious: for
the symplectic form to exist the Poisson tensor has to be invertible. In the
singular case, however, derivations do not form a projective module and it is
less clear what non-degenerate means. For a symplectic singularity one may
naively ask if there is indeed an analogue of a symplectic form. We examine an
example of a symplectic singularity, namely the double cone, and show that here
such a symplectic form exists. We use the naive de Rham complex of a
Lie-Rinehart algebra. Our analysis of the double cone relies on Gr\"obner bases
calculations.

                                        <span>  The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of
the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by
compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019,
surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular
forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive
array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural
questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the
different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular
forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group
$SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular
forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form
strcuture by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with
supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued
quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat
Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it
was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat
Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold,
suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by
providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite
family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third,
we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type
invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator
algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of
logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.

propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a
reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand
the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in
time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the
correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density
functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density
possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has
not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving
method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests
on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large
time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density
matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our
results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the
$4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our
calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of
electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This
calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix
is constant and equals the number of electrons.

principle, arbitrary) system of partial differential equations -- based on an
intuitive ``educated guess'' -- into the Euler-Lagrange one attached to a
Lagrangian, by adding a canonical correction term. Here, we extend this
technique to theories that involve at least two sets of dynamical variables :
we show that an educated guess of the field equations with respect to one of
these sets of variables only is sufficient to variationally complete these
equations and recover a Lagrangian for the full theory, up to terms that do not
involve the respective variables.
  Applying this idea to natural metric-affine theories of gravity, we prove
that, starting from an educated guess of the metric equations only, one can
find the full metric equations, together with a generally covariant Lagrangian
for the theory, up to metric-independent terms; the latter terms (which can
only involve the distortion of the connection) are then completely classified
over 4-dimensional spacetimes, by techniques pertaining to differential
invariants.

                                        <span>  Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single
part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum
information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascu\'es et al, NJP 10,7,073013
(2008)], known as the NPA hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial
optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent
hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite
programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network
correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum
systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several
generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the Scalar Extension
[Pozas-Kerstjens et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced
while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new
hierarchy, prove its equivalence to the Scalar Extension, and characterise its
convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario, and
explore its relations with the known generalisations.

Schr\"odinger operator $-\hbar^2\Delta+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the
semiclassical limit as $\hbar\to0$. We prove local uniform convergence of the
rescaled integral kernel of this projector towards a universal model, inside
the classically allowed region as well as on its boundary. This implies
universality of microscopic fluctuations for the corresponding free fermions
(determinantal) point processes, both in the bulk and around regular boundary
points. Our results apply for a general class of smooth potentials in arbitrary
dimension $n\ge 1$. These results are complemented by studying both macroscopic
and mesoscopic fluctuations of the point process. We obtain tail bounds for
macroscopic linear statistics and, provided $n\geq 2$, a central limit theorem
for both macroscopic and mesoscopic linear statistics in the bulk.

                                        <span>  The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental
features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by
finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light
cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies
have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most
experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in
the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in
nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study
reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in
interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the
spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump
together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson
number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a
provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The
results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide
the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.

                                        <span>  We study the ground state energy of a gas of 1D bosons with density $\rho$,
interacting through a general, repulsive 2-body potential with scattering
length $a$, in the dilute limit $\rho |a|\ll1$. The first terms in the
expansion of the thermodynamic energy density are $\pi^2\rho^3/3(1+2\rho a)$,
where the leading order is the 1D free Fermi gas. This result covers the
Tonks-Girardeau limit of the Lieb-Liniger model as a special case, but given
the possibility that $a>0$, it also applies to potentials that differ
significantly from a delta function. We include extensions to spinless fermions
and 1D anyonic symmetries, and discuss an application to confined 3D gases.

a parameterization and on a tangential tensor field. The flow allows for
dissipation by evolving the parameterization and the tensor field
simultaneously. This requires the choice of a notation for independence. We
introduce different gauges of surface independence and show their consequences
for the evolution. In order to guarantee a decrease in energy, the gauge of
surface independence and the time derivative have to be chosen consistently. We
demonstrate the results for a surface Frank-Oseen-Hilfrich energy.

and M-theory in terms of exceptional generalised geometry is observed. Previous
constructions are extended in two ways: from internal $d$-dimensional space to
full 11- or 10-dimensional spacetimes, by coupling to the tensor hierarchy
gauge fields, and from $E_{d(d)}$ with $d\leq 6$ to $E_{7(7)}$ and $E_{8(8)}$.
This is done by a clarification of the role of the tensor hierarchy and its end
in the context of brane world-volume theories. The exceptional structure of the
gauged $\sigma$-model of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is provided as a new
example.

equilibrium solutions of both the collisonless Boltzmann equation and of the
Euler equations in MOND. This is the first such stability result that is proven
with mathematical rigour in MOND. While we strive to prove our stability
theorems, we develop new, genuinely Mondian ideas how arising mathematical
difficulties can be solved. At some points it was necessary to restrict our
analysis to spherical symmetry. We discuss every point where this extra
assumption was necessary and outline which efforts must be undertaken to get
along without it in future works. In the end we show on the example of a
polytropic model how our stability result can be applied.

with polynomial superpotential by using the exact WKB method and the TBA
equations. We apply the ODE/IM correspondence to the Schr\"odinger equation
with an effective potential deformed by integrating out the fermions, which
admits a continuous deformation parameter. We find that the TBA equations are
described by the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended ones. For cubic superpotential
corresponding to the symmetric double-well potential, the TBA system splits
into the two $D_3$-type TBA equations. We investigate in detail this example
based on the TBA equations and their analytic continuation as well as the
massless limit. We find that the energy spectrum obtained from the exact
quantization condition is in good agreement with the diagonalization approach
of the Hamiltonian.

Proc. R. Soc. A 473, 20170494), is a striking example of a model with
long-range isotropic interactions whose ground states break rotational
symmetry. In this work we analyze and explain the nature of this symmetry
breaking with emphasis on the importance of dimensionality. Interestingly,
rotational symmetry is recovered in three dimensions for small jumps, which
correspond to the non-isotropic cogwheel regime of the two-dimensional problem.
We discuss simplified models that reproduce the symmetry properties of the
original system in N dimensions. For the full grasshopper model in two
dimensions we obtain quantitative predictions for optimal perturbations of the
disk. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

                                        <span>  Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with
applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum
field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian
random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the
metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of
the curvature in each point of the manifold. In this study, our hypothesis is
that time irreversibility in Gaussian random fields dynamics is a direct
consequence of geometric properties (curvature) of their parametric space. In
order to validate this hypothesis, we compute the components of the metric
tensor and derive the twenty seven Christoffel symbols of the metric to define
the Euler-Lagrange equations, a system of partial differential equations that
are used to build geodesic curves in Riemannian manifolds. After that, by the
application of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulation, we numerically build geodesic curves starting from an arbitrary
initial point in the manifold. The obtained results show that, when the system
undergoes phase transitions, the geodesic curve obtained by time reversing the
computational simulation diverges from the original curve, showing a strange
effect that we called the geodesic dispersion phenomenon, which suggests that
time irreversibility in random fields is related to the intrinsic geometry of
their parametric space.

$A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$ of $3d, \mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, that is, the
quantum Hamiltonian reductions of Weyl algebras. In theories which are good, we
define a twisted trace that arises naturally from the correlation functions of
the gauge theory. We show that this trace induces an inner product and a short
star product on $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$.
  We analyze this trace in the case of an abelian gauge group and show that it
has a natural expansion in terms of the twisted traces of Verma modules,
confirming a conjecture of the first author and Okazaki. This expansion has a
natural interpretation in terms of 3-d mirror symmetry, and we predict that it
can be interpreted as an Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formula under the quantum
Hikita isomorphism.

                                        <span>  It is shown that any mathematical solution for null electromagnetic field
knots in flat spacetime is also a null field knotted solution for cosmological
electromagnetic fields. This is obtained by replacing the time $t\rightarrow
\tau=\int dt/a$, where $a=a(t)$ is the scale factor of the Universe described
by the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology, and by adequately
rewriting the (empty flat spacetimes) electromagnetic fields solutions in a
medium defined by the FLRW metric. We found that the dispersion (evolution) of
electromagnetic Hopfions is faster on cosmological scenarios.
  We discuss the implications of these results for different cosmological
models.

                                        <span>  We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual
characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has
several markedly different properties for M>2. In particular, it has a large
non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The
states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the
interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads
to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this
fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra
of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain.
We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered
version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M,
using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by
generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and
apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.

                                        <span>  Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able
to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed.
Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain
regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This
may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We
discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show
that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly
with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the
contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting
and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave
function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the
conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations
in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature
bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions
to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.

thermal fluctuations to the Casimir effect on a traversable wormhole. This was
done by using finite temperature generalization of the Casimir effect as a
source of a hot traversable wormhole. Thus, we have considered a more physical
scenario, where the effects of thermal fluctuations are also considered as a
source of a traversable wormhole. To obtain a dependence on such a thermal
Casimir effect, consider the plates positioned at a distance either
parametrically fixed or radially varying. In both cases, the temperature
effects are investigated. We demonstrate that thermal fluctuations modify the
throat of the wormhole. Such results have been obtained in both regimes, i.e.
high temperature and low temperature. We explicitly investigate the effect of
such finite temperature effects on the size of a wormhole.

proper power spectrum, enhanced density perturbations can decouple from the
Hubble flow, turn around and collapse. In contrast to what happens in a
radiation dominated Universe where pressure nullifies deviations from
sphericity in these perturbations, in a matter dominated Universe, the lack of
pressure although on the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it
allows small deviations from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse
takes place. The subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical
deviations grow, the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich
pancake". After that, the more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent
relaxation begins where shells of the cloud cross and the matter is
redistributed within a factor of a few of the free fall timescale, reaching a
spherical virialized state. During the whole process, strong gravitational
waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the collapse and the small time
interval that the effect takes place. The emission of gravitational waves
during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be easily estimated with an
analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to capture the behaviour of

                                        <span>  In the work of Phys. Rev. A 100, 042710 (2019), it was argued that the
general description of two-body Feshbach resonances requires "closed-channel
parameters" related to the bare bound state causing the resonance. The present
work shows that once the resonance theory is renormalised (i.e. its parameters
are expressed in terms of physical observables) the dependence of two-body
observables on the closed-channel parameters disappears when the inter-channel
coupling is localised in a region where the wave functions are energy
independent. In such a regime, the resulting quantum defect theory is
surprisingly independent of the bare bound state energy. This result highlights
a qualitative difference between resonances in this regime, such as magnetic
resonances in ultracold atoms, and other kinds of resonances, such as hadron
resonances. Although the closed-channel parameters of magnetic resonances do
not affect two-body observables, it is suggested that they could be evidenced
experimentally from short-distance probing and three-body observables.

fields, such as NS5-branes. Two branes are dual after compactifications on
spheres with gauge fluxes. The conjecture follows from simple considerations on
string worldsheet theories. For some NS5-branes, we get level-rank dualities of
Chern-Simons theories. Application of the dualities to a newly found brane in
heterotic string theory reveals surprising properties of the worldvolume theory
on it, for which we give evidence from anomaly inflow.

                                        <span>  The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of
the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by
compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019,
surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular
forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive
array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural
questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the
different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular
forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group
$SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular
forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form
strcuture by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with
supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued
quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat
Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it
was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat
Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold,
suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by
providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite
family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third,
we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type
invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator
algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of
logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.

tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by
another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0
determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the
formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired
model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent
heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation
functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in
a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of
differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method
well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of
next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear
picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables
sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair
stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis
constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic
matter.

covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's
wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions
the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove
that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a
physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis
is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are
consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a
Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the
Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.

                                        <span>  We construct tree-level amplitude for massive particles using on-shell
recursion relations based on two classes of momentum shifts: an all-line
transverse shift that deforms momentum by its transverse polarization vector,
and a massive BCFW-type shift. We illustrate that these shifts allow us to
correctly calculate four-point and five-point amplitudes in massive QED,
without an ambiguity associated with the contact terms that may arise from a
simple ``gluing'' of lower-point on-shell amplitudes. We discuss various
aspects and applicability of the two shifts, including the large-z behavior and
complexity scaling. We show that there exists a ``good'' all-line transverse
shift for all possible little group configurations of the external particles,
which can be extended to a broader class of theories with massive particles
such as massive QCD and theories with massive spin-1 particles. The massive
BCFW-type shift enjoys more simplicity, but a ``good'' shift does not exist for
all the spin states due to the specific choice of spin axis.

Abelian, vector (Proca) field during inflation in the presence of nonminimal
coupling to gravity may suffer from an instability which leads to runaway
production of high-momentum modes. This is untenable unless there is some
mechanism to regulate the runaway. We discuss the parameter space of the
particle mass and nonminimal couplings where such a runaway occurs and possible
ways to tame the runaway. We find that there is no obvious way to resolve the
runaway in a UV completion or with kinetic mixing to the standard model.

                                        <span>  Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source
has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast
with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics
is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a
key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum,
conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the
probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of
such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno
effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a
good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is
the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not
possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant
times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior
is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative
calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes
that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance
dilaton production in a medium.

                                        <span>  In six dimensions, there is an exotic $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ supermultiplet that
contains only fields of spin $\leq 2$, but no graviton, and that on a circle
reduces to 5D $\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity. It has been proposed that, if
suitable interactions exist, the $(4,0)$ theory might provide a consistent
alternative UV completion for $\mathcal{N}=4$ 5D supergravity, realizing a
supersymmetric version of asymptotic safety. In this note we argue that any
Lorentz-invariant $(4,0)$ theory (interacting or not) carries an exact global
symmetry when compactified on $S^1$, and is therefore incompatible with the
Swampland no global symmetries conjecture. Another example of exotic
supergravity, the 6D $(3,1)$ theory, does not have this problem. We study the
general case and find that the only exotic spin-2 field that reduces to
Einsteinian gravity and has no global symmetries when compactified on a
high-dimensional torus is that of the $(3,1)$ theory. All other possibilities
either yield several gravitons or have global symmetries.

of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of
a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the
scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order
processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external
field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction
effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated
Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of
final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final
gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well
as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum
parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the
characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An
unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and
gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant
process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial
electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have
been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial
electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At
the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process
significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding
non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new
physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born
near neutron stars and magnetars.

$X^n$ and its mirror partner $\check{X}^n$. Then, by SYZ transform, we can
construct a holomorphic line bundle with an integrable connection from each
pair of a Lagrangian section of $\check{X}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ and
a unitary local system along it, and those holomorphic line bundles with
integrable connections forms a dg-category $DG_{X^n}$. In this paper, we focus
on a certain B-field transform of the generalized complex structure induced
from the complex structure on $X^n$, and interpret it as the deformation
$X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ of $X^n$ by a flat gerbe $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, we
construct the deformation of $DG_{X^n}$ associated to the deformation from
$X^n$ to $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$, and also discuss the homological mirror symmetry
between $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ and its mirror partner on the object level.

with non-invertible symmetries or anomalies. Focusing on integrable flows to
gapped phases in two dimensions, we find that S-matrices derived previously
from the bootstrap approach are incompatible with non-invertible symmetries
along the flow. We present consistent alternatives, which however violate
standard crossing symmetry and obey modified rules dictated by fusion
categories. We extend these rules to theories with discrete anomalies.

                                        <span>  It is well known that the experience of a linearly accelerated observer with
acceleration $a$, interacting with a massless scalar field in its vacuum state
in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime, is identical to that of a static observer
interacting with a massless scalar field in a thermal state of temperature
$a/2\pi$ in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime. We study the robustness of this duality
by comparing an observer undergoing circular motion in a thermal bath with an
observer that undergoes circular motion around a linearly accelerated
trajectory. We find that in most regimes, observers in these two cases
experience the field in different ways, and are generally able to tell the
difference between the two cases by measuring observables localized along their
trajectories.

                                        <span>  In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse
topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase
transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We
demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology
groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly
locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling.
Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation
of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer
ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the
study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.

                                        <span>  The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental
features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by
finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light
cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies
have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most
experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in
the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in
nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study
reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in
interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the
spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump
together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson
number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a
provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The
results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide
the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.

                                        <span>  We revisit the study of string theory close to the Hagedorn temperature with
the aim towards cosmological applications. We consider interactions of open and
closed strings in a gas of D$p-$branes, and/or one isolated D$p$-brane, in an
arbitrary number $d$ of flat non-compact dimensions and general compact
dimensions. Leading order string perturbation theory is used to obtain the
basic interaction rates in a flat background, which are shown to be consistent
with the random walk picture of highly excited strings that should apply in
more general backgrounds. Using the random walk interpretation we infer the
structure of more general semi-inclusive string scattering rates and then write
down the corresponding Boltzmann equations describing ensembles of highly
excited closed and open strings. We organise the interaction terms in Boltzmann
equations so that detailed balance becomes manifest. We obtain the equilibrium
solutions and show that they reduce to previously computed solutions for $d=0$.
We further study the behaviour of non-equlibrium fluctuations and find explicit
analytic expressions for the equilibration rates (and for the number of open
strings in $d=0$). Potential implications for an early universe with strings at
high temperatures are outlined.

                                        <span>  Using first-principle numerical simulations of the lattice SU(3) gauge
theory, we calculate the isothermal moment of inertia of the rigidly rotating
gluon plasma. We find that the moment of inertia unexpectedly takes a negative
value below the "supervortical temperature" $T_s = 1.50(10) T_c$, vanishes at
$T = T_s$, and becomes a positive quantity at higher temperatures. The negative
moment of inertia indicates a thermodynamic instability of rigid rotation. We
derive the condition of thermodynamic stability of the vortical plasma and show
how it relates to the scale anomaly and the magnetic gluon condensate. The
rotational instability of gluon plasma shares a striking similarity with the
rotational instabilities of spinning Kerr and Myers-Perry black holes.

                                        <span>  Previous work has given proof and evidence that BPS states in local
Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be described and counted by exponential networks on the
punctured plane, with the help of a suitable non-abelianization map to the
mirror curve. This provides an appealing elementary depiction of moduli of
special Lagrangian submanifolds, but so far only a handful of examples have
been successfully worked out in detail. In this note, we exhibit an explicit
correspondence between torus fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points on
$\mathbb C^2\subset\mathbb C^3$ and anomaly free exponential networks attached
to the quadratically framed pair of pants. This description realizes an
interesting, and seemingly novel, "age decomposition" of linear partitions. We
also provide further details about the networks' perspective on the full
D-brane moduli space.

and M-theory in terms of exceptional generalised geometry is observed. Previous
constructions are extended in two ways: from internal $d$-dimensional space to
full 11- or 10-dimensional spacetimes, by coupling to the tensor hierarchy
gauge fields, and from $E_{d(d)}$ with $d\leq 6$ to $E_{7(7)}$ and $E_{8(8)}$.
This is done by a clarification of the role of the tensor hierarchy and its end
in the context of brane world-volume theories. The exceptional structure of the
gauged $\sigma$-model of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is provided as a new
example.

                                        <span>  We define generalised Gaussian states for quantum cosmological models based
on the $\mathfrak{su(1,1)}$ algebra, with particular emphasis on its
realisation in group field theory for a single field mode, and study their
semiclassical properties. These states are generalisations of coherent,
squeezed and thermal states considered previously. As two possible
characterisations of semiclassicality, we contrast the requirement of small
relative fluctuations in volume and energy with the saturation of the
Robertson--Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle. We find that for the most
general class of states the appearance of small relative fluctuations, which we
take as the main criterion relevant for the emergence of cosmology, is mostly
determined by the amount of displacement used to define the state. We also
observe that defining such generalised Gaussian states is less straightforward
in the algebraic approach to canonical quantisation of group field theory, and
discuss special cases.

argue for a bulk dual given by $N$ copies of an abelian Chern-Simons theory

exchanging the $N$ copies. As a check of this proposal, we calculate the
ensemble average of various partition and correlation functions of the

gauge theory quantities in the bulk. We comment on the ensemble average of the
tensionless string partition function on $\text{AdS}_3 \times \text{S}^3 \times

asymptotically approach flat space, both with a massless and a massive dilaton,
and focussing on homogeneous perturbations. We find massless wormholes to
always be perturbatively stable. The phenomenologically more relevant case of a
massive dilaton presents us with a wide variety of wormhole solutions,
depending on the dilaton coupling and mass, and on the axion charge. We find
that the solutions with the smallest dilaton potential are perturbatively
stable and dominant, even in cases where the wormhole solutions are not
continuously connected to the massless case by decreasing the mass. For
branches of solutions emanating from a bifurcation point, one side of the
branch always contains a negative mode in its spectrum, rendering such
solutions unstable. The existence of classes of perturbatively stable wormhole
solutions with massive dilaton sharpens the puzzles associated with Euclidean
wormholes.

                                        <span>  First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are
predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative
corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes.
We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough
supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few
parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a
previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of
theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that
correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar
timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded
by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future
gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter
space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such
phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this
model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a
phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos
and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.

with polynomial superpotential by using the exact WKB method and the TBA
equations. We apply the ODE/IM correspondence to the Schr\"odinger equation
with an effective potential deformed by integrating out the fermions, which
admits a continuous deformation parameter. We find that the TBA equations are
described by the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended ones. For cubic superpotential
corresponding to the symmetric double-well potential, the TBA system splits
into the two $D_3$-type TBA equations. We investigate in detail this example
based on the TBA equations and their analytic continuation as well as the
massless limit. We find that the energy spectrum obtained from the exact
quantization condition is in good agreement with the diagonalization approach
of the Hamiltonian.

this can lead to the generation of a distinguishable primordial stochastic
background of gravitational waves. We first show how in the simplest majoron
model only a contribution from cosmic string can be within the reach of planned
experiments. We then consider extensions containing multiple complex scalars,
demonstrating how in this case a spectrum comprising contributions from both a
strong first order phase transition and cosmic strings can naturally emerge. We
show that the interplay between multiple scalar fields can amplify the phase
transition signal, potentially leading to double peaks over the wideband sloped
spectrum from cosmic strings. We also underscore the possibility of observing
such a gravitational wave background to provide insights into the reheating
temperature of the universe. We conclude highlighting how the model can be
naturally combined with scenarios addressing the origin of matter of the
universe, where baryogenesis occurs via leptogenesis and a right-handed
neutrino plays the role of dark matter.

                                        <span>  We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D)
topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that
the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological
order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground
state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence,
previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is
more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out"
anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons
generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric
under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking
connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem
codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders.
Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a
classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and
even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered
states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a
partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.

$[SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)_Y]/\mathbb{Z}_q$ with $q=1,2,3,6$. Using these
quantization conditions, we prove that any QCD axion model to the right of the

the axion domain wall problem in a post-inflationary scenario. We further
demonstrate the higher-group and non-invertible global symmetries in the
Standard Model coupled to a single axion. These generalized global symmetries
lead to universal bounds on the axion string tension and the monopole mass. If
the axion were discovered in the future, our quantization conditions could be
used to constrain the global form of the Standard Model gauge group.

local effective action for background fields -- a "thermal effective action."
This effective action determines the asymptotic density of states of a CFT as a
detailed function of dimension and spin. We discuss subleading perturbative and
nonperturbative corrections to the density, comparing with free and holographic
examples. We furthermore show how to use the thermal effective action on more
complicated geometries at special locations called "hot spots." The hot spot
idea makes a prediction for a CFT partition function on a higher-dimensional
version of a genus-2 Riemann surface, in a particular high temperature limit.
By decomposing the partition function into a novel higher-dimensional version
of genus-2 conformal blocks (which we compute at large scaling dimension), we
extract the asymptotic density of heavy-heavy-heavy OPE coefficients in a
higher-dimensional CFT. We also compute asymptotics of thermal 1-point
functions using the same techniques.

                                        <span>  We study twisted traces on the quantum Higgs branches
$A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$ of $3d, \mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, that is, the
quantum Hamiltonian reductions of Weyl algebras. In theories which are good, we
define a twisted trace that arises naturally from the correlation functions of
the gauge theory. We show that this trace induces an inner product and a short
star product on $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$.
  We analyze this trace in the case of an abelian gauge group and show that it
has a natural expansion in terms of the twisted traces of Verma modules,
confirming a conjecture of the first author and Okazaki. This expansion has a
natural interpretation in terms of 3-d mirror symmetry, and we predict that it
can be interpreted as an Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formula under the quantum
Hikita isomorphism.

electroweak corrections can be taken into account by using electroweak

that weak isospin conservation in these equations imposes to modify the
expressions of the splitting functions commonly used in the literature. These

                                        <span>  The theory of inflation provides an elegant explanation for the nearly flat
universe observed today, which represents one of the pillars of the standard
cosmological model. However, recent studies have reported some deviations from
a flat geometry, arguing that a closed universe would be instead favored by
observations. Given its central role played in the cosmological context, this
paper revisits the issue of spatial curvature in light of the stochastic
gravitational wave background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav
collaboration. For this purpose, we investigate the primordial gravitational
waves generated during inflation and their propagation in the post-inflationary
universe. We propose a new parametrization of the gravitational wave power
spectrum, taking into account spatial curvature, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and
the spectral index of tensor perturbations. Therefore, we compare the
theoretical predictions with NANOGrav data to possibly constrain the geometry
of the universe. We find that the choice of the priors has a significant effect
on the computed posterior distributions. In particular, using flat uniform
priors results in $\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= 0.00 \pm 0.67$ at the 68\%
confidence level. On the other hand, imposing a Planck prior, we obtain
$\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= -0.05 \pm 0.17$ at the 68\% confidence level. This
result aligns with the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation,
and no deviations from a flat universe are found.

                                        <span>  We investigate a class of gravity theories respecting only spatial
covariance, termed spatially covariant gravity, in the presence of an auxiliary
scalar field. We examine the conditions on the Lagrangian required to eliminate
scalar degrees of freedom, allowing only two tensorial degrees of freedom to
propagate. Instead of strict constraint analysis, in this work, we employ the
perturbation method and focus on the necessary conditions to evade the scalar
mode at linear order in perturbations around a cosmological background.
Starting from a general action and solving the auxiliary perturbation variables
in terms of the would-be dynamical scalar mode, we derive the condition to
remove its kinetic term, thus ensuring that no scalar mode propagates. As an
application of the general condition, we study a polynomial-type Lagrangian as
a concrete example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars
containing two derivatives. We find that the auxiliary scalar field plays a
nontrivial role, and new terms in the Lagrangian are allowed. Our analysis
sheds light on constructing gravity theories with two degrees of freedom in the
extended framework of spatially covariant gravity.

observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band.
This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of
Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA
Data Challenge 2a is focused on the robust signal extraction from a blend of
these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high
performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and
characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and
estimate the noise of the residual. We preform the pipeline in a time-evolving
weekly analysis starting with and observation time of 1 week until we reach a
full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole
binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument
noise by each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a
novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple
massive black hole binaries. Additionally we demonstrate a massive black hole
binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher
harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.

                                        <span>  Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able
to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed.
Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain
regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This
may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We
discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show
that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly
with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the
contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting
and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave
function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the
conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations
in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature
bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions
to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.

                                        <span>  This research investigates the impact of the nature of Dark Energy (DE) on
structure formation, focusing on the matter power spectrum and the Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). By analyzing the matter power spectrum at redshifts
$z = 0$ and $z = 5$, as well as the ISW effect on the scale of $\ell = 10-100$,
the study provides valuable insights into the influence of DE equations of
state (EoS) on structure formation. The findings reveal that dynamical DE
models exhibit a stronger matter power spectrum compared to constant DE models,
with the JBP model demonstrating the highest amplitude and the CPL model the
weakest. Additionally, the study delves into the ISW effect, highlighting the
time evolution of the ISW source term $\mathcal{F}(a)$ and its derivative
$d\mathcal{F}(a)/da$, and demonstrating that models with constant DE EoS
exhibit a stronger amplitude of $\mathcal{F}(a)$ overall, while dynamical
models such as CPL exhibit the highest amplitude among the dynamical models,
whereas JBP has the lowest. The study also explores the ISW auto-correlation
power spectrum and the ISW cross-correlation power spectrum, revealing that
dynamical DE models dominate over those with constant DE EoS across various
surveys. Moreover, it emphasizes the potential of studying the non-linear
matter power spectrum and incorporating datasets from the small scales to
further elucidate the dynamical nature of dark energy. This comprehensive
analysis underscores the significance of both the matter power spectrum and the
ISW signal in discerning the nature of dark energy, paving the way for future
research to explore the matter power spectrum at higher redshifts and in the
non-linear regime, providing deeper insights into the dynamical nature of dark
energy.

thermal fluctuations to the Casimir effect on a traversable wormhole. This was
done by using finite temperature generalization of the Casimir effect as a
source of a hot traversable wormhole. Thus, we have considered a more physical
scenario, where the effects of thermal fluctuations are also considered as a
source of a traversable wormhole. To obtain a dependence on such a thermal
Casimir effect, consider the plates positioned at a distance either
parametrically fixed or radially varying. In both cases, the temperature
effects are investigated. We demonstrate that thermal fluctuations modify the
throat of the wormhole. Such results have been obtained in both regimes, i.e.
high temperature and low temperature. We explicitly investigate the effect of
such finite temperature effects on the size of a wormhole.

unidirectional electromagnetic field interacting with a scalar field. We
consider the minimal interaction and the non-minimal interaction by the law
$f^2(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The Horndeski theory allows anisotropy to grow
over time, so the question arises of regulating the anisotropic level in this
theory. Using the reconstruction method, we build models in which the
anisotropic level tends to a small value as the Universe expands. One of the
results is a model with a anisotropic bounce.

simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We
obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new
watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced
with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and
void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to
empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles
based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent
with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We
study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly
demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We
find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global
average and the kinetic curvature density parameter in the centre of voids
reaches ~60-80%. Within the limits of resolution of the simulations, the
results are consistent with the parameters of the Timescape model of
cosmological backreaction.

proper power spectrum, enhanced density perturbations can decouple from the
Hubble flow, turn around and collapse. In contrast to what happens in a
radiation dominated Universe where pressure nullifies deviations from
sphericity in these perturbations, in a matter dominated Universe, the lack of
pressure although on the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it
allows small deviations from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse
takes place. The subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical
deviations grow, the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich
pancake". After that, the more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent
relaxation begins where shells of the cloud cross and the matter is
redistributed within a factor of a few of the free fall timescale, reaching a
spherical virialized state. During the whole process, strong gravitational
waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the collapse and the small time
interval that the effect takes place. The emission of gravitational waves
during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be easily estimated with an
analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to capture the behaviour of
matter during this stage in order to estimate the precise spectrum of
gravitational waves produced in this scenario.

equations and recover a Lagrangian for the full theory, up to terms that do not
involve the respective variables.
  Applying this idea to natural metric-affine theories of gravity, we prove
that, starting from an educated guess of the metric equations only, one can
find the full metric equations, together with a generally covariant Lagrangian
for the theory, up to metric-independent terms; the latter terms (which can
only involve the distortion of the connection) are then completely classified
over 4-dimensional spacetimes, by techniques pertaining to differential
invariants.

                                        <span>  We demonstrate that gravitational particle production (GPP) of a massive,
Abelian, vector (Proca) field during inflation in the presence of nonminimal
coupling to gravity may suffer from an instability which leads to runaway
production of high-momentum modes. This is untenable unless there is some
mechanism to regulate the runaway. We discuss the parameter space of the
particle mass and nonminimal couplings where such a runaway occurs and possible
ways to tame the runaway. We find that there is no obvious way to resolve the
runaway in a UV completion or with kinetic mixing to the standard model.

to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant always carry hair. We show that the same
mechanism that creates the hair makes it incompatible with a cosmological
horizon. Other scalar-tensor models do not have this problem when
time-dependence of the scalar provides a natural matching to cosmology.
Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet is particularly rigid and such a scenario does not help. An
extra operator makes the theory behave like the other models and the
cosmological horizon can be accommodated. The hair, however, is drastically
altered.

merger simulations
(\href{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html}{https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/catalog.html})
from the SXS collaboration~\cite{Hinder:2017sxy}, we present convincing
evidence that the waveform phenomenology in eccentric BBH mergers is
significantly simpler than previously thought. We find that the eccentric
modulations in the amplitudes, phases, and frequencies in different spherical
harmonic modes are all related and can be modeled using a single time series
modulation. Using this universal eccentric modulation, we provide a model named
\texttt{gwNRHME} to seamlessly convert a multi-modal (i.e with several
spherical harmonic modes) quasi-circular waveform into multi-modal eccentric
waveform if the quadrupolar eccentric waveform is known. This reduces the
modelling complexity of eccentric BBH mergers drastically as we now have to
model only a single eccentric modulation time-series instead of modelling the
effect of eccentricity in all modes. When compared with the NR simulations, our
model mismatches are mostly $\sim 10^{-3}$ and are comparable to the numerical
errors in the NR simulations. Our method is modular and can be readily added to
any quadrupolar non-spinning eccentric waveform model. We make our model
publicly available through the \texttt{gwModels}
(\href{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels}{https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels})
waveform package.

acceleration $a$, interacting with a massless scalar field in its vacuum state
in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime, is identical to that of a static observer
interacting with a massless scalar field in a thermal state of temperature
$a/2\pi$ in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime. We study the robustness of this duality
by comparing an observer undergoing circular motion in a thermal bath with an
observer that undergoes circular motion around a linearly accelerated
trajectory. We find that in most regimes, observers in these two cases
experience the field in different ways, and are generally able to tell the
difference between the two cases by measuring observables localized along their
trajectories.

capabilities of future ground-based gravitational-wave detector networks --
composed of A+ or Voyager upgrades to the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories
and proposed next generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein
Telescope. These metrics refer to coalescences of binary neutron stars (BNSs)
and binary black holes (BBHs) and include: (i) network detection efficiency and
detection rate of cosmological sources as a function of redshift, (ii)
signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy with which intrinsic and extrinsic
parameters would be measured, and (iii) enabling multimessenger astronomy with
gravitational waves by accurate 3D localization and early warning alerts. We
further discuss the science enabled by the small population of rare and
extremely loud events. While imminent upgrades will provide impressive advances
in all these metrics, next generation observatories will deliver an improvement
of an order-of-magnitude or more in most metrics. In fact, a network containing
two or three such facilities will detect half of all the BNS and BBH mergers up
to a redshift of $z=1$ and $z=20$, respectively, give access to hundreds of
BNSs and ten thousand BBHs with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 100, readily
localize hundreds to thousands of mergers to within $1\,{\rm deg^2}$ on the sky
and better than 10% in luminosity distance, respectively, and consequently,
enable mutlimessenger astronomy through follow-up surveys in the
electromagnetic spectrum several times a week. Such networks will further shed
light on potential cosmological merger populations and detect an abundance of
high-fidelity BNS and BBH signals which will allow investigations of the
high-density regime of matter at an unprecedented level and enable precision
tests of general relativity in the strong-filed regime, respectively.

                                        <span>  We implement an eccentric search for compact binary mergers based on particle
swarm optimization. Orbital eccentricity is an invaluable input for
understanding the formation scenarios of the binary mergers and can play a
pivotal role in finding their electromagnetic counterparts. Current modelled
searches rely on pre-computed template banks that are computationally expensive
and resistant towards expanding the search parameter space dimensionality. On
the other hand, particle swarm optimization offers a straightforward algorithm
that dynamically selects template points while exploring an arbitrary
dimensional parameter space. Through extensive evaluation using simulated
signals from spin-aligned eccentric binary mergers, we discovered that the
search exhibits a remarkable autonomy in capturing the effects of both
eccentricity and spin. We describe our search pipeline and revisit some of the
merger candidates from the gravitational wave transient catalogs.

                                        <span>  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying
weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining
cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features.
The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks
and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring
cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing
diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of
primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of
lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we
explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++
algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields,
namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB
delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB
angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of
the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed
CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the
impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB
delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for
this analysis is available on GitHub.

                                        <span>  In this letter we explore the foundations of entropic cosmology and highlight
some important flaws which have emerged and adopted in the recent literature.
We argue that, when applying entropy and temperature on the cosmological
horizon by assuming the holographic principle for all thermodynamic approaches
to cosmology and gravity, one must derive the consistent thermodynamic
quantities following Clausius relation. One key assumption which is generally
overlooked, is that in this process one must assume a mass-to-horizon relation,
which is generally taken as a linear one. We show that, regardless of the type
of entropy chosen on the cosmological horizon, when a thermodynamically
consistent corresponding temperature is considered, all modified entropic force
models are equivalent to and indistinguishable from the original entropic force
models based on standard Bekenstein entropy and Hawking temperature. As such,
they are also plagued by the same problems and inability to describe in a
satisfactory qualitative and quantitative way the cosmological dynamics as it
emerges from the probes we have. We also show that the standard accepted
parameterization for Hawking temperature (including a $\gamma$ rescaling) is
actually not correctly applied, namely, it is not related to entropy in a
thermodynamically consistent way. Finally, we clearly state that the explicit
form of the entropic force on cosmological horizons is mostly dictated by the
assumption on the mass-to-horizon relation. As such, we discuss what should be
done in order to fix all such issues, and what conceptually could be implied by
its correct implementation in order to advance in the field.

array (PTA) datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian and stationary
process described by a power-law. In practice, none of these properties are
expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic
ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which is expected to be
the primary signal in the PTA band. We perform a systematic investigation of
the performance of current search algorithms, using a simple power law model to
characterize GW signals in realistic datasets. We use, as the baseline dataset,
synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA (EPTA)
second data release (DR2). Thus, we include in the dataset uneven time stamps,
achromatic and chromatic red noise and multi-frequency observations. We then
inject timing residuals from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law
stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs, performing a
methodical investigation of the recovered signal. We find that current search
models are efficient at recovering the GW signal, but several biases can be
identified due to the signal-template mismatch, which we identify via
probability-probability (P-P) plots and quantify using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
statistics. We discuss our findings in light of the signal observed in the EPTA
DR2 and corroborate its consistency with an SMBHB origin.

on the $\mathfrak{su(1,1)}$ algebra, with particular emphasis on its
realisation in group field theory for a single field mode, and study their
semiclassical properties. These states are generalisations of coherent,
squeezed and thermal states considered previously. As two possible
characterisations of semiclassicality, we contrast the requirement of small
relative fluctuations in volume and energy with the saturation of the
Robertson--Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle. We find that for the most
general class of states the appearance of small relative fluctuations, which we
take as the main criterion relevant for the emergence of cosmology, is mostly
determined by the amount of displacement used to define the state. We also
observe that defining such generalised Gaussian states is less straightforward
in the algebraic approach to canonical quantisation of group field theory, and
discuss special cases.

asymptotically approach flat space, both with a massless and a massive dilaton,
and focussing on homogeneous perturbations. We find massless wormholes to
always be perturbatively stable. The phenomenologically more relevant case of a
massive dilaton presents us with a wide variety of wormhole solutions,
depending on the dilaton coupling and mass, and on the axion charge. We find
that the solutions with the smallest dilaton potential are perturbatively
stable and dominant, even in cases where the wormhole solutions are not
continuously connected to the massless case by decreasing the mass. For
branches of solutions emanating from a bifurcation point, one side of the
branch always contains a negative mode in its spectrum, rendering such
solutions unstable. The existence of classes of perturbatively stable wormhole
solutions with massive dilaton sharpens the puzzles associated with Euclidean
wormholes.

                                        <span>  First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are
predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative
corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes.
We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough
supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few
parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a
previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of
theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that
correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar
timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded
by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future
gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter
space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such
phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this
model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a
phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos
and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.

                                        <span>  In General Relativity, there are only two polarizations for gravitational
waves. However, up to six polarizations are possible in a generic metric theory
of gravity. Therefore, measuring the polarization content of gravitational
waves provides an efficient way to test theories of gravity. We analyze the
sensitivity of a next-generation ground-based detector network to nontensorial
polarizations. We present our method to localize GW signals in the
time-frequency domain and construct the model-independent null stream for
events with known sky locations. We obtain results based on simulations of
binary neutron star mergers in a six-detector network. For a single event at a
luminosity distance $D_L=100 \, {\rm Mpc}$, at $5\sigma$ confidence, the
smallest amplitude for detection of scalar and vector modes relative to tensor
modes are respectively $A_{s}=0.045 $ and $A_{v}=0.014 $. For multiple events
in an averaged observing run of 10 years, the detection limits at $5\sigma$
confidence are $A_s=0.05$ and $A_v=0.02$. If we are fortunate, a few strong
events might significantly improve the limits.

assumed to have formed deep in the radiation-dominated era from amplified
primordial perturbations. In this work we improve the previous works for the
calculation of UDMH abundance by elaborating on the formation process of these
halos by including various physical and geometrical modifications in the
analysis. In particular, we investigate the impact of angular momentum,
dynamical friction and triaxial collapse on the predicted mass functions for
UDMHs. We perform the calculations for four primordial power spectra with
different amplified features that allow for primordial black hole and UDHM
formation in wide and narrow mass ranges. We also apply this analysis in the
context of two possible scenarios for dark matter: the single-component and the
multi-component. We find that the abundance of UDMHs is prominently enhanced in
the presence of these more realistic mass functions.

gravity theory, namely $f(Ric, T)=Ric+2\lambda T$. The wormhole solution is
analyzed using an exponential shape function. The study examines various
parameters, such as density, radial pressure, transverse pressure,
equation-of-state parameters, and energy conditions, within the framework of
deformed gravity. The research emphasizes the influence of the parameter
$\lambda$ on energy condition violations and the equilibrium state of the
Finslerian wormhole solution. These effects are attributed to anisotropic and
hydrostatic forces present in modified gravity. The study demonstrates that the
gravity model effectively captures the characteristics of wormholes within the
Finslerian space-time. Additionally, the identified features of the wormhole
are utilized to visualize its structure by creating a three-dimensional
representation of the embedded surface. In summary, this research contributes
to understanding wormholes in modified gravity theories, highlighting the
importance of the parameter $\lambda$ in determining their behavior and
properties.

knots in flat spacetime is also a null field knotted solution for cosmological
electromagnetic fields. This is obtained by replacing the time $t\rightarrow
\tau=\int dt/a$, where $a=a(t)$ is the scale factor of the Universe described
by the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology, and by adequately
rewriting the (empty flat spacetimes) electromagnetic fields solutions in a

electromagnetic Hopfions is faster on cosmological scenarios.

symmetric, metrically stationary, isolated spinning source made of perfect
fluid is examined within the quasi-metric framework. (A metrically stationary
system is defined as a system which is stationary except for the direct effects
of the global cosmic expansion on the space-time geometry.) Field equations are
set up and an attempt is made to find an approximate series solution for the
exterior part. However, the result is that no stationary solution corresponding
to a spinning source can exist when considering terms beyond a certain order in
small quantities. That is, except for metrically static systems, axially
symmetric systems must necessarily be non-stationary in quasi-metric gravity.
However, sufficiently weak, axially symmetric gravitational fields associated
with slowly rotating sources, may still be considered as stationary as an
excellent approximation.
  Thus a truncated, approximately stationary solution is found for the exterior
field. To lowest order in small quantities, the gravito-magnetic part of the
found metric family corresponds with the Kerr metric in the metric
approximation. On the other hand, the gravito-electric part of the found metric
family also includes a tidal term characterized by the free quadrupole-moment
parameter $J_2$ describing the effect of source deformation due to the
rotation. This term has no counterpart in the Kerr metric. Finally, the
geodetic effect for a gyroscope in orbit is calculated. There is a correction
term, unfortunately barely too small to be detectable by Gravity Probe B, to
the standard expression.

                                        <span>  Multiquark systems appear less frequently than mesons and baryons despite the
enormous world-wide experimental effort that has been made during the last two
decades. In this work, we will propose a possible explanation for that fact,
restricting ourselves to the case of sets including only $c$ and $\bar{c}$
quarks. We will show that those multiquarks can be thought as different
combinations of smaller units that associate together to produce colorless
assemblies with a definite value of the total spin. For instance, for the
$cccccc$ hexaquark with $S=0$, we have three possibilities: a set of six
undistinguishable $c$ quarks, an association of two $ccc$ baryons, or a set of
three $cc$ diquarks close together. This means we can have three different
values for the mass of an open-charm hexaquark with $S=0$. Using the diffusion
Monte Carlo method, we calculate all possible combinations compatible with
tetraquark $cc \bar{c} \bar{c}$, pentaquark $cccc \bar{c}$, open-charm $cccccc$
and hidden-charm $ccc \bar{c} \bar{c} \bar{c}$ hexaquark structures with the
minimum value of total spin ($S=0$ or $S=1/2$). We consider compact structures
with radial wave functions including interactions between all the quarks in the
cluster. We find that, in all cases, the mass of the multiquark decreases with
the number of small units that conform the set of quarks. For instance, an open
charm hexaquark made up of three diquarks has a smaller mass than a set of six
of $c$ undistinguishable units. When the pieces that conform the multiquark are
themselves colorless with a definite value of the total spin, the cluster
splits into those smaller units that separate infinitely from each other.

                                        <span>  In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse
topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase
transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We
demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology
groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly
locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling.
Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation
of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer
ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the
study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.

theory, we calculate the isothermal moment of inertia of the rigidly rotating
gluon plasma. We find that the moment of inertia unexpectedly takes a negative
value below the "supervortical temperature" $T_s = 1.50(10) T_c$, vanishes at
$T = T_s$, and becomes a positive quantity at higher temperatures. The negative
moment of inertia indicates a thermodynamic instability of rigid rotation. We
derive the condition of thermodynamic stability of the vortical plasma and show
how it relates to the scale anomaly and the magnetic gluon condensate. The
rotational instability of gluon plasma shares a striking similarity with the
rotational instabilities of spinning Kerr and Myers-Perry black holes.

interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to
such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the
junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two
reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode
associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped
mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing
Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a
supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect
the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.

orientation of ion trap principal axes. The application of DC voltage to the
ground electrodes, commonly employed to finely tune trap frequencies in ion
traps, leads to the rotation of the trap principal axes. Analyzing the ion
matter-wave interference signal enables us to determine the directions of the
trap principal axes. Both the experiments and simulations reveal an
avoided-crossing behavior resulting from the coupling between the trap radial
axes. Additionally, simulations indicate that symmetric trap structures lack
this coupling, suggesting that trap structure asymmetry causes coupling between
the axes. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into ion traps for
diverse applications in quantum science and technology.

Bose-Einstein condensates is proposed by employing two-component chirped
frequency parametric driving or modulation of the interaction strength within
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A weakly nonlinear theory of the process is
developed using Whitham's averaged variational principle yielding reduction to
a two-degrees-of-freedom dynamical system in action-angle variables.
Additionally, the theory also delineates permissible driving parameters and
establishes thresholds on the driving amplitudes required for autoresonant
excitation.

                                        <span>  The effective control of atomic coherence with cold atoms has made atom
interferometry an essential tool for quantum sensors and precision
measurements. The performance of these interferometers is closely related to
the operation of large wave packet separations. We present here a novel
approach for atomic beam splitters based on the stroboscopic stabilization of
quantum states in an accelerated optical lattice. The corresponding Floquet
state is generated by optimal control protocols. In this way, we demonstrate an
unprecedented Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) interferometer, with a momentum
separation of 600 photon recoils ($600\hbar k$) between its two arms. Each LMT
beam splitter is realized in a remarkably short time (2 ms) and is highly
robust against the initial velocity dispersion of the wave packet and lattice
depth fluctuations. Our study shows that Floquet engineering is a promising
tool for exploring new frontiers in quantum physics at large scales, with
applications in quantum sensing and testing fundamental physics.

                                        <span>  In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection
of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type
molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state
coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses
technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer
the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train
of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible
transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found
that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with
the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon
detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident
pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced
three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired
population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and,
it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently
transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the
populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.

                                        <span>  Rydberg atom,which exhibits a strong response to weak electric(E) fields,is
regarded as a promising atomic receiver to surpass sensitivity of conventional
receivers. However, its sensitivity is strongly limited by the noise coming
from both classical and quantum levels and how to enhance it significantly
remains challenging. Here we experimentally prove that the sensitivity of
Rydberg atomic receiver can be increased to 23 nV/cm/Hz1/2 by combining laser
arrays. Theoretically, we demonstrate that multiple beams illuminating on a PD
perform better than multiple PDs for laser arrays.In our experiment,10 dB SNR
enhancement is achieved by utilizing 2 * 2 probe beam arrays, compared to the
performance of a laser beam,and it can be enhanced further just by adding a
resonator. The results could offer an avenue for the design and optimization of
ultrahigh-sensitivity Rydberg atomic receivers and promote applications in
cosmology, meteorology, communication, and microwave quantum technology.

of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both
classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of
open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can
lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that
allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the
appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the
non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in
the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our
proposed criterion.

the two qubits are strongly coupled to the cavity field, the collective

quantify the entanglement in terms of concurrence. Additionally, we study the

desired atoms. We investigate the population evolution of Cesium atoms by
employing Liouville equation. For this purpose, we apply a circularly polarized
light at a frequency suitable for electronic transition from ground states to
excited states and calculate the relaxation rate, repopulation, and population
evolution of the Cesium Zeeman sublevels. For engineering the sublevel
population after optical pumping, we employ a radiofrequency (RF) field and
consider the effect of RF field in Liouville equation. With this approach, we
are able to prepare desired distribution of the population in the atomic
sublevels with high efficiency, which can be employed in different optical
experiments.

to a cavity mode. Releasing a cold atomic ensemble above the resonator, we
apply a push beam along the direction of gravity, offering fast atomic

when the push beam is illuminated against gravity, single atoms slow down and
even turn around in the mode, through the cavity-transmission measurement. Our

                                        <span>  Phase and time delays of atomic above-threshold ionization are usually
experimentally explored by the reconstruction of attosecond harmonic beating by
interference of two-photon transitions (RABBIT) technique. Theoretical studies
of RABBIT rely on the perturbative treatment of the probe (NIR or visible)
laser pulse with respect to the atomic electric field and the pump composed of
a train of attosecond pulses made of several harmonics with frequencies
multiple of the probe fundamental frequency. In this work we present a
semiclassical non-perturbative description of the phase delays for the emission
of electrons from hydrogen atoms based on the strong-field approximation as the
relative phase between pump and probe pulses is varied, where more than two
photons are involved. Ionization times are calculated within the saddle-point
approximations and serve to individualize the different electron wave packets
that produce the RABBIT interferometric scheme. We observe different behaviors
of the phase delays at different intensities of the probe. For example, for
moderate and intense probe fields, the harmonics and sidebands happen to be in
phase ($ \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{11}$ W/cm$^2$). In turn, when the probe field is
sufficiently weak, we recover the well-known rule of thumb for the phase delays
developed within the perturbative RABBIT theory [see D. Guenot et al. Phys.
Rev. A 85, 053424 (2012)]. We show that the intracycle interference of the
different paths contributing to the final energy (sideband or high harmonic) is
responsible for the different behaviors of the interference pattern.
Comparisons with the numerical solution of the strong-field approximation and
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation confirm the reliability of our
semiclassical non-perturbative theory.

                                        <span>  Sampling from the output distributions of quantum computations comprising
only commuting gates, known as instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP)
computations, is believed to be intractable for classical computers, and hence
this task has become a leading candidate for testing the capabilities of
quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that for an arbitrary IQP circuit
undergoing dephasing or depolarizing noise, whose depth is greater than a
critical $O(1)$ threshold, the output distribution can be efficiently sampled
by a classical computer. Unlike other simulation algorithms for quantum
supremacy tasks, we do not require assumptions on the circuit's architecture,
on anti-concentration properties, nor do we require $\Omega(\log(n))$ circuit
depth. We take advantage of the fact that IQP circuits have deep sections of
diagonal gates, which allows the noise to build up predictably and induce a
large-scale breakdown of entanglement within the circuit. Our results suggest
that quantum supremacy experiments based on IQP circuits may be more
susceptible to classical simulation than previously thought.

the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping
for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the
Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate
applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit
operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected
advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its
rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time
evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for
qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable
improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we develop a systematic way to characterize the 't Hooft
anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the
environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type.
By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we
incorporate them in a unified framework and calculate their anomalies. In the
case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry
and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are
classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial
dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we
generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases
as long as the weak symmetry is imposed.
  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy
physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time
dynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems.
Notably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state
shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous
symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We
discuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such
unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of
the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D
and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state
symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge
theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.

                                        <span>  Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the
$^{13}$C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the
optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize $^{13}$C spins at
room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by
using a combination of surface treatment improving the $^{13}$C relaxation
($T_1$) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV
illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Monitoring the light-induced
redistribution of the NV spin state populations with electron paramagnetic
resonance, a strong polarization enhancement for the NV spin state is observed
in a narrow spectral region corresponding to about 4\% of these defect centers.
By combining adjustments to the `PulsePol' sequence and slow sample rotation,
the NV-$^{13}$C polarization transfer rate is improved further. The
hyperpolarized $^{13}$C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2 $\mu$m and 100
nm median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29 T magnetic
field), of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of
room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based
on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.

                                        <span>  We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic
Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the
considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to
its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that
originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps
between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the
relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge.
With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic
systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size,
as long as the initial state is prepared in a low energy sector of polynomial
size. We achieve the latter via a fast, quasi-adiabatic sweep from a parameter
regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We generalize the algorithm
to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard
model.

                                        <span>  Attribute to their robustness against loss and external noise, nonreciprocal
photonic devices hold great promise for applications in quantum information
processing. Recent advancements have demonstrated that nonreciprocal optical
transmission in linear systems can be achieved through the strategic
introduction of loss. However, a crucial question remains unanswered: can loss
be harnessed as a resource for generating nonreciprocal quantum correlations?
Here, we take a counterintuitive stance by engineering loss to generate a novel
form of nonreciprocal quantum correlations, termed nonreciprocal photon
blockade. We examine a dissipative three-cavity system comprising two nonlinear
cavities and a linear cavity. The interplay of loss and nonlinearity leads to a
robust nonreciprocal single- and two-photon blockade, facilitated by
destructive quantum interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of
this nonreciprocal photon blockade by manipulating the relative phase between
the two nonlinear cavities. Remarkably, this allows for the reversal of the
direction of nonreciprocity. Our study not only sheds new light on the concept
of loss-engineered quantum nonreciprocity but also opens up a unique pathway
for the design of quantum nonreciprocal photonic devices.

generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian
mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables
form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this
paper, we introduce \emph{Lie quandles} as the minimal mathematical structure
needed to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is
based on the notion of a quandle used primarily in knot theory, whose main
defining property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y
\triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$.
We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of
Lie algebras. We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in
vector spaces, which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the
same form of self-distributivity.

used to explain the localization of eigenmodes near system boundaries, though
the former is arguably more accurate in some regimes due to its incorporation
of quantum jumps. However, these frameworks predominantly focus on weak
Markovian interactions, neglecting the potentially crucial role of memory
effects. To address this, we investigate, utilizing the powerful hierarchical
equations of motion method, how a non-Markovian environment can modify the
Liouvillian skin effect. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian environment can
induce not only a ``thick skin effect", where the skin mode broadens and shifts
into the bulk, but also skin-mode coherence, leading to the
coherence-delocalization and oscillatory relaxation with a characteristic
linear scaling with system size. Remarkably, both the skin-mode and
steady-state coherence exhibit resistance to decoherence from additional
environmental noise. These findings highlight the profound impact of
system-bath correlations on relaxation and localization, revealing unique
phenomena beyond conventional Markovian approximations.

                                        <span>  In this work, maximal $\alpha$-leakage is introduced to quantify how much a
quantum adversary can learn about any sensitive information of data upon
observing its disturbed version via a quantum privacy mechanism. We first show
that an adversary's maximal expected $\alpha$-gain using optimal measurement is
characterized by measured conditional R\'enyi entropy. This can be viewed as a
parametric generalization of K\"onig et al.'s famous guessing probability
formula [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 55(9), 2009]. Then, we prove that the
$\alpha$-leakage and maximal $\alpha$-leakage for a quantum privacy mechanism
are determined by measured Arimoto information and measured R\'enyi capacity,
respectively. Various properties of maximal $\alpha$-leakage, such as data
processing inequality and composition property are established as well.
Moreover, we show that regularized $\alpha$-leakage and regularized maximal
$\alpha$-leakage for identical and independent quantum privacy mechanisms
coincide with $\alpha$-tilted sandwiched R\'enyi information and sandwiched
R\'enyi capacity, respectively.

                                        <span>  The problem of quantum state preparation is one of the main challenges in
achieving the quantum advantage. Furthermore, classically, for multi-level
problems, our ability to solve the corresponding quantum optimal control
problems is rather limited. The ability of the latter to feed into the former
may result in significant progress in quantum computing. To address this
challenge, we propose a formulation of quantum optimal control that makes use
of artificial boundary conditions for the Schr\"odinger equation in combination
with spectral methods. The resulting formulations are well suited for
investigating periodic potentials and lend themselves to direct numerical
treatment using conventional methods for bounded domains.

simulation is a fundamental task in the quantum information theory. In this
paper, we show that, under the purified distance, the quantum channel
simulation can be directly achieved via quantum state splitting without using a
technique known as the de Finetti reduction, and thus provide a pair of tighter
one-shot bounds. Using the bounds, we also recover the quantum reverse Shannon
theorem in a much simpler way.

                                        <span>  Quantum circuit partitioning is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that aims
to simulate large quantum systems on smaller quantum computers. The quantum
computation is divided into smaller circuits and results of measurements on
these circuits are combined using classical processing. Current approaches
involve performing the Hadamard test or SWAP test and thus require an ancillary
qubit with full qubit-connectivity. In this study, we show that for certain
quantum states and observables, the approach can be realized by performing
simple measurements of expectation values. However, this comes with a
limitation on the applicable space of quantum states and observables. The
approach was demonstrated in the realm of quantum machine learning,
specifically to the digits dataset. When applied to the classification between
the digits 3 and 6, we were able to generalize to out-of-sample data with an
accuracy of $100 \%$.

                                        <span>  Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator
complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos
coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity
growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the
Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose
the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak
ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic
regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly
ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a
collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking
leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of
different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We
test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East
model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak
ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on
the Krylov chain.

orientation of ion trap principal axes. The application of DC voltage to the
ground electrodes, commonly employed to finely tune trap frequencies in ion
traps, leads to the rotation of the trap principal axes. Analyzing the ion
matter-wave interference signal enables us to determine the directions of the
trap principal axes. Both the experiments and simulations reveal an
avoided-crossing behavior resulting from the coupling between the trap radial
axes. Additionally, simulations indicate that symmetric trap structures lack
this coupling, suggesting that trap structure asymmetry causes coupling between
the axes. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into ion traps for
diverse applications in quantum science and technology.

                                        <span>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent one of the most widely used
neural network architectures, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in
computer vision tasks. Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy,
their size can be effectively reduced by "tensorization" while maintaining
accuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with
compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or
quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly
training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards
low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the
accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution
kernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we
truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50
pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We
found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be
truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but
not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation
compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how
information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated
models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs
of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of
convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our
results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we consider the standard quantum information decoupling, in
which Alice aims to decouple her system from the environment by local
operations and discarding some of her systems. To achieve an
$\varepsilon$-decoupling with trace distance as the error criterion, we
establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization for the largest dimension of
the remainder system in terms of the conditional
$(1-\varepsilon)$-hypothesis-testing entropy. When the underlying system is
independent and identically prepared, our result leads to the matched
second-order rate as well as the matched moderate deviation rate. As an
application, we find an achievability bound in entanglement distillation
protocol, where the objective is for Alice and Bob to transform their quantum
state to maximally entangled state with largest possible dimension using only
local operations and one-way classical communications.

                                        <span>  The effective control of atomic coherence with cold atoms has made atom
interferometry an essential tool for quantum sensors and precision
measurements. The performance of these interferometers is closely related to
the operation of large wave packet separations. We present here a novel
approach for atomic beam splitters based on the stroboscopic stabilization of
quantum states in an accelerated optical lattice. The corresponding Floquet
state is generated by optimal control protocols. In this way, we demonstrate an
unprecedented Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) interferometer, with a momentum
separation of 600 photon recoils ($600\hbar k$) between its two arms. Each LMT
beam splitter is realized in a remarkably short time (2 ms) and is highly
robust against the initial velocity dispersion of the wave packet and lattice
depth fluctuations. Our study shows that Floquet engineering is a promising
tool for exploring new frontiers in quantum physics at large scales, with
applications in quantum sensing and testing fundamental physics.

                                        <span>  In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection
of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type
molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state
coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses
technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer
the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train
of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible
transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found
that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with
the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon
detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident
pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced
three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired
population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and,
it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently
transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the
populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.

means to control and read out cryogenic electronic components. The challenge is
to achieve sufficient signal integrity with low heat load processing. In this
context, we demonstrate the opto-electronic bias and readout of a commercial
four-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array using a
cryogenic photodiode and laser. We show that this approach has a similar system
detection efficiency to a conventional bias. Furthermore, multi-pixel detection
events are faithfully converted between the optical and electrical domain,
which allows reliable extraction of amplitude multiplexed photon statistics.
Our device has a passive heat dissipation of 2.6mW, maintains the signal rise
time of 3ns, and operates in free-running (self-resetting) mode at a repetition
rate of 600kHz. This demonstrates the potential of high-bandwidth, low noise,
and low heat load opto-electronic interconnects for scalable cryogenic signal
processing and transmission.

                                        <span>  The concepts of topology and geometry are of critical importance in exploring
exotic phases of quantum matter. Though they have been investigated on various
experimental platforms, to date a direct probe of topological and geometric
properties on a universal quantum computer even for a minimum model is still in
vain. In this work, we first show that a density matrix form of the quantum
geometric tensor (QGT) can be explicitly re-constructed from Pauli operator
measurements on a quantum circuit. We then propose two algorithms, suitable for
IBM quantum computers, to directly probe QGT. The first algorithm is a
variational quantum algorithm particularly suitable for Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era devices, whereas the second one is a pure
quantum algorithm based on quantum imaginary time evolution. Explicit results
obtained from IBM Q simulating a Chern insulator model are presented and
analysed. Our results indicate that transmon qubit-based universal quantum
computers have the potential to directly simulate and investigate topological
and geometric properties of a quantum system.

Gottesmann-Kitaev-Preskill and squeezed cat codes, is robust against photon
loss, but the computation accuracy is limited by the available squeezing level.
Here, we introduce the \textit{projective squeezing} (PS) method for computing
outcomes for a higher squeezing level by revealing that a linear combination of
displacement operators with periodic displacement values constitutes the
smeared projector onto the better code space; we also show the analytical
relationship between the increased squeezing level and the projection
probability. We introduce concrete implementation methods for PS based on
linear-combination-of-unitaries and virtual quantum error detection. We also
numerically verify our analytical arguments and show that our protocol can
mitigate the effect of photon loss.

                                        <span>  Artificial quantum systems have emerged as indispensable platforms to realize
exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate
topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and
two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a
scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). We engineered with atomic precision both
topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and
second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were
probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution.
The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly
visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states,
topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an
important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of
interacting spins.

output given from a quantum computer is correct. Existing verification
protocols conducted between a quantum computer to be verified and a verifier
necessitate quantum communication to unconditionally detect any malicious
behavior of the quantum computer solving any promise problem in ${\sf BQP}$. In
this paper, we remove the necessity of the communication of qubits by proposing
a "physically-classical" verification protocol in which the verifier just sends
coherent light to the quantum computer.

                                        <span>  Quantum nondeterministic distributed computing was recently introduced as
dQMA (distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur) protocols by Fraigniaud, Le Gall,
Nishimura and Paz (ITCS 2021). In dQMA protocols, with the help of quantum
proofs and local communication, nodes on a network verify a global property of
the network. Fraigniaud et al. showed that, when the network size is small,
there exists an exponential separation in proof size between distributed
classical and quantum verification protocols, for the equality problem, where
the verifiers check if all the data owned by a subset of them are identical. In
this paper, we further investigate and characterize the power of the dQMA
protocols for various decision problems.
  First, we give a more efficient dQMA protocol for the equality problem with a
simpler analysis. This is done by adding a symmetrization step on each node and
exploiting properties of the permutation test, which is a generalization of the
SWAP test. We also show a quantum advantage for the equality problem on path
networks still persists even when the network size is large, by considering
``relay points'' between extreme nodes.
  Second, we show that even in a general network, there exist efficient dQMA
protocols for the ranking verification problem, the Hamming distance problem,
and more problems that derive from efficient quantum one-way communication
protocols. Third, in a line network, we construct an efficient dQMA protocol
for a problem that has an efficient two-party QMA communication protocol.
  Finally, we obtain the first lower bounds on the proof and communication cost
of dQMA protocols. To prove a lower bound on the equality problem, we show any
dQMA protocol with an entangled proof between nodes can be simulated with a
dQMA protocol with a separable proof between nodes by using a QMA
communication-complete problem introduced by Raz and Shpilka (CCC 2004).

and quantum computing, in particular, in fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC).
The FBQC model is a framework for universal quantum computing provided that we
are able to perform entangling measurements, called fusions, on qubits within
small entangled resource states. Here we analyse the usage of different
linear-optical BSM circuits as fusions in the FBQC schemes and numerically
evaluate hardware requirements for fault-tolerance in this framework. We
examine and compare the performance of several BSM circuits with varying
additional resources and estimate the requirements on losses for every
component of the linear-optical realization of fusions under which errors in
fusion networks caused by these losses can be corrected. Our results show that
fault-tolerant quantum computing in the FBQC model is possible with currently
achievable levels of optical losses in an integrated photonic implementation,
provided that we can create and detect single photons of the resource states
with a total marginal efficiency higher than 0.973.

challenging frontier of physics. In this work, we systematically construct
solvable non-integrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact Markovian subsystem
dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables
for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show
that the effect of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be
analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the
subsystem boundary. The realization of exact Markovian property is facilitated
by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum
circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local
Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.

                                        <span>  Photon loss represents a major challenge for the implementation of quantum
communication protocols with untrusted devices, e.g. in the device-independent
(DI) or semi-DI approaches. Determining critical loss thresholds is usually
done in case-by-case studies. In the present work, we develop a general
framework for characterizing the admissible levels of loss and noise in a wide
range of scenarios and protocols with untrusted measurement devices. In
particular, we present general bounds that apply to prepare-and-measure
protocols for the semi-DI approach, as well as to Bell tests for DI protocols.
A key step in our work is to establish a general connection between quantum
protocols with untrusted measurement devices and the fundamental notions of
channel extendibility and joint-measurability, which capture essential aspects
of the communication and measurement of quantum information. In particular,
this leads us to introduce the notion of partial joint-measurability, which
naturally arises within quantum cryptography.

free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In
particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system
with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field
theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a
half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result
is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with
the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an
excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes
asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient
chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper
continuum limit.

reverse-time back-propagation to solve otherwise prohibitively large
open-system quantum control problems. Our approach enables the optimization of
arbitrary cost functions with fully general controls applied on large open
quantum systems described by a Lindblad master equation. It is scalable,
computationally efficient, and has a low memory footprint. We apply this
framework to optimize two inherently dissipative operations in superconducting
qubits which lag behind in terms of fidelity and duration compared to other
unitary operations: the dispersive readout and all-microwave reset of a
transmon qubit. Our results show that, given a fixed set of system parameters,
shaping the control pulses can yield 2x improvements in the fidelity and
duration for both of these operations compared to standard strategies. Our
approach can readily be applied to optimize quantum controls in a vast range of
applications such as reservoir engineering, autonomous quantum error
correction, and leakage-reduction units.

                                        <span>  Tracking a magnetic field in real-time with an atomic magnetometer presents
significant challenges, primarily due to sensor non-linearity, the presence of
noise, and the need for one-shot estimation. To address these challenges, we
propose a comprehensive approach that integrates measurement, estimation and
control strategies. Specifically, this involves implementing a quantum
non-demolition measurement based on continuous light-probing of the atomic
ensemble. The resulting photocurrent is then directed into an Extended Kalman
Filter to produce instantaneous estimates of the system's dynamical parameters.
These estimates, in turn, are utilised by a Linear Quadratic Regulator, whose
output is applied back to the system through a feedback loop. This procedure
automatically steers the atomic ensemble into a spin-squeezed state, yielding a
quantum enhancement in precision. Furthermore, thanks to the feedback proposed,
the atoms exhibit entanglement even when the measurement data is discarded. To
prove that our approach constitutes the optimal strategy in realistic
scenarios, we derive ultimate bounds on the estimation error applicable in the
presence of both local and collective decoherence, and show that these are
indeed attained. Additionally, we demonstrate for large ensembles that the EKF
not only reliably predicts its own estimation error in real time, but also
accurately estimates spin-squeezing at short timescales.

example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological

Hamiltonians which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and are
embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. We provide a general mechanism to
construct partially integrable models with arbitrarily large local Hilbert
space dimensions, which host exact many-body scars. We introduce designed
integrability-breaking terms to several exactly solvable spin chains, whose
integrable Hamiltonians are composed of the generators of the Temperley-Lieb
algebra. In the non-integrable subspace of these models, we identify a special
kind of product states -- the generalized spin helix states as exact quantum
many-body scars, which lie in the common null space of the non-Hermitian
generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and are annihilated by the
integrability-breaking terms. Our constructions establish an intriguing
connection between integrability and quantum many-body scars, meanwhile provide
a systematic understanding of scarred Hamiltonians from the perspective of
non-Hermitian projectors.

a convolution kernel nature that can be exploited by the Fourier transform. It
is well known that many quantum algorithms that have provably demonstrated a
speedup over classical algorithms utilize the quantum Fourier transform. In
this work, we explore quantum circuits that can efficiently express a
self-attention mechanism through the perspective of kernel-based operator
learning. In this perspective, we are able to represent deep layers of a vision
transformer network using simple gate operations and a set of multi-dimensional
quantum Fourier transforms. We analyze the computational and parameter
complexity of our novel variational quantum circuit, which we call
Self-Attention Sequential Quantum Transformer Channel (SASQuaTCh), and
demonstrate its utility on simplified classification problems.

of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both
classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of
open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can
lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that
allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the
appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the
non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in
the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our
proposed criterion.

                                        <span>  Recently, a polynomial time classical algorithm has been found for learning
the shallow representation of a unitary $U$ acting on $n$-qubits, by learning
local inversions and then sewing them back together with ancilla qubits and
SWAP gates. In this work, we bootstrap local inversion learning (LIL) to
optimize quantum circuit depth by learning shallow representations for its
sub-unitaries. We recursively cut circuits and apply the LIL algorithm to
replace sub-circuits with their shallow representations, if it can be found by
the algorithm. If not, we keep cutting until the optimization terminates,
either by finding shallow representations or by reaching constant-depth
sub-circuits. By replacing sub-circuits with their shallow representations, we
hope to obtain some compression of the quantum circuit. Due to the binary
search structure, the optimization algorithm has time complexity logarithmic in
the depth of the original given circuit.

                                        <span>  Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component
system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting
mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra
and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the
strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant.
Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects
of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this
work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of
two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square
optical lattice. Particularly we examine the transition when both the
components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF) or
supersolid (SS) phases. Our study prevails that, similar to the contact
interactions, the MIT can be influenced by competing intra and inter-component
density induced tunnelings and off-site interactions. To probe the MIT in the
strongly interacting regime, we study the extended version of the Bose-Hubbard
model with the density induced tunneling and nearest-neighbouring interaction
terms, and focus in the regime where the hopping processes are considerably
weaker than the on-site interaction. We solve this model through
site-decoupling mean-field theory with Gutzwiller ansatz and characterize the
miscibility through the site-wise co-existence of the two-component across the
lattice. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility
properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.

permuting the values of the Wigner function in accordance with a symplectic
linear transformation is equivalent to performing a certain unitary
transformation on the state. That is, performing this unitary transformation is
simply a matter of moving Wigner-function values around in phase space. This
result holds in particular for the simplest discrete Wigner function defined on
a $d \times d$ phase space when the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ is odd. It does
not hold for a $d \times d$ phase space if the dimension is even. Here we show,
though, that a generalized version of this correspondence does apply in the
case of a two-qubit phase space. In this case, a symplectic linear permutation
of the points of the phase space, together with a certain reinterpretation of
the Wigner function, is equivalent to a unitary transformation.

                                        <span>  Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic
non-Abelian statistics and having potential applications to fault-tolerant
quantum computing. While the prior research has predominantly focused on
non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent
progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring a
notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work,
we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which
host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental
results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that
protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the
PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own
parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into
separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the
parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective
braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA
statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a
tri-junction. We also propose a correlated quantum nanowire model that
accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the
generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems
capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our
comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that
govern the exchange dynamics.

sensing technologies. Ongoing miniaturization calls for ever-smaller sensors
maintaining good measurement performance. Here, we present a fully integrated
mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor capable of $5.9\,\mathrm{nT}/
\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity utilizing $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$
sized microdiamonds at a microwave power of $50\,\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power
of $2.15\,\mathrm{mW}$. A direct laser writing process is used to localize a
diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core by a polymer structure.
This structure enables stable optical access and independent guiding of
excitation and fluorescent light in different optical fibers. This separation
strongly reduces the contribution of autofluorescence from the excitation light
in the optical fiber. Moreover, a metallic direct laser written antenna
structure is created next to the fibers' facet, allowing microwave manipulation
of the NV centers' spins. The fabricated endoscopic sensor provides a robust
platform with a tip diameter of $1.25\,\mathrm{mm}$. The device enables remote
optical and microwave access to perform the full range of coherent spin
measurements with NV centers at a spatial resolution of $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$.
We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a
magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments,
opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are
necessary.

                                        <span>  The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a
quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In
this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver
is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an
error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message
conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting
postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the
postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter
characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement
assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing
that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a
variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so
by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower
bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper
bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As
such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even
when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on
communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike
curves.

                                        <span>  The electromagnetic Casimir effect has a fermionic counterpart in topological
insulators: Zero-point fluctuations of a massless Dirac fermion field mediate a
force between magnetic scatterers. The Casimir force is insensitive to disorder
that preserves the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone. The
protection may be broken if the Dirac equation is discretized, and an
exponential suppression of the Casimir effect will result if a gap opens at the
Dirac point. Here we show how this lattice artefact may be avoided, by applying
a recently developed local discretization of the Euclidean action that does not
suffer from the fermion-doubling obstruction of local discretizations of the
Hamiltonian.

quantum information to large-scale physics, with a quantum mechanically

applications in quantum communication, sensing, simulation and computing.
However, a full characterization of multimode quantum states requires a number
of experiments that grows exponentially with the number of modes. Here we
propose an alternative approach where the goal is not to reconstruct the full
quantum state, but rather to estimate its characteristic function at a given
set of points. For multimode states with reflection symmetry, we show that the
characteristic function at $M$ points can be estimated using only $O(\log M)$
copies of the state, independently of the number of modes. The number of copies
can be further reduced to a constant when the characteristic function is known
to be positive, as in the case of squeezed vacuum states. In these cases, the
estimation is achieved by an experimentally friendly setup using only
beamsplitters and homodyne measurements.

                                        <span>  Optical pumping is a technique for engineering atomic-sublevel population of
desired atoms. We investigate the population evolution of Cesium atoms by
employing Liouville equation. For this purpose, we apply a circularly polarized
light at a frequency suitable for electronic transition from ground states to
excited states and calculate the relaxation rate, repopulation, and population
evolution of the Cesium Zeeman sublevels. For engineering the sublevel
population after optical pumping, we employ a radiofrequency (RF) field and
consider the effect of RF field in Liouville equation. With this approach, we
are able to prepare desired distribution of the population in the atomic
sublevels with high efficiency, which can be employed in different optical
experiments.

                                        <span>  Recently it has been shown that transmon qubit architectures experience a
transition between a many-body localized and a quantum chaotic phase. While it
is crucial for quantum computation that the system remains in the localized
regime, the most common way to achieve this has relied on disorder in Josephson
junction parameters. Here we propose a quasi-periodic patterning of parameters
as a substitute for random disorder. We demonstrate, using the Walsh-Hadamard
diagnostic, that quasiperiodicity is more effective than disorder for achieving
localization. In order to study the localizing properties of our new
Hamiltonian for large, experimentally relevant system sizes, we use two
complementary perturbation-theory schemes, one with respect to the many-body
interactions and one with respect to hopping parameter of the free Hamiltonian.

                                        <span>  Nonlinear systems are important in many areas of modern science and
technology. For example, nonlinearity plays an essential role in generating
quantum mechanical states of both light and matter. As a result, there has been
great interest in understanding the fundamental quantum nature of a variety of
nonlinear effects. At the same time, there is currently a large gap between the
classical and quantum understanding of nonlinear systems, with the classical
understanding being far more developed. To close this gap, we introduce a
general new theory which allows us to predict quantum effects in any nonlinear
system purely in terms of its classical description. We demonstrate the
predictions of our theory in experiments probing quantum fluctuations of
intense femtosecond pulses propagating in an optical fiber undergoing
soliton-fission supercontinuum generation, a process where broadband radiation
is produced by a narrow-band input. Famously, this process is known to be
highly noise-sensitive, leading to noisy outputs even from inputs with only
quantum fluctuations. In contrast, our experiments uncovered a variety of
previously hidden low-noise and noise-robust states arising from quantum
correlations and entanglement, in agreement with the predictions of our theory.
We also show how the theory points to new design concepts for controlling
quantum noise in optics and beyond. We expect that our results will provide a
template for discovering quantum effects in a wide variety of complex nonlinear
systems.

                                        <span>  During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly,
limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum
information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to
local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly
affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum
information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to
large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently
introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different
scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which
we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a
controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems
up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by
solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the
information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale
information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the
microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at
which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to
accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call
local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for
investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum
systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy
transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open
XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The
information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful
results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body
systems.

for future large-scale quantum computers thanks to their flexible optical
interface, (relatively) high operating temperature, and high-fidelity
operation. Similar to other quantum-computing platforms, the electrical
interface required to control and read out such qubits may limit both the
performance of the whole system and its scalability. To address this challenge,
this work analyzes the requirements of the electrical interface and
investigates how to efficiently implement the electronic controller in a
scalable architecture comprising a large number of identical unit cells. Among
the different discussed functionalities, a specific focus is devoted to the
generation of the static and dynamic magnetic fields driving the electron and
nuclear spins, because of their major impact on fidelity and scalability.
Following the derived requirements, different system architectures, such as a
qubit frequency-multiplexing scheme, are considered to identify the most power
efficient approach, especially in the presence of inhomogeneity of the qubit
Larmor frequency across the processor. As a result, a
non-frequency-multiplexed, 1-mm$^2$ unit-cell architecture is proposed as the
optimal solution, able to address up to one electron-spin qubit and 9
nuclear-spin qubits within a 3-mW average power consumption, thus establishing
the baseline for the scalable electrical interface for future large-scale
color-center quantum computers.

essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is
known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum
system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible
measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of
incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell
inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set
of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which
do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a
fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality,
pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource.
In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can
always be certified in a device-independent manner.

                                        <span>  We study whether a generic isolated quantum system initially set out of
equilibrium can be considered as localized close to its initial state. Our
approach considers the time evolution in the Krylov basis, which maps the
dynamics onto that of a particle moving in a one-dimensional lattice where both
the energy in the lattice sites and the tunneling from one lattice site to the
next are inhomogeneous. By tying the dynamical propagation in the Krylov basis
to that in the basis of microstates, we infer qualitative criteria to
distinguish systems that remain localized close to their initial state from
systems that undergo quantum thermalization. These criteria are
system-dependent and involve the expectation values and standard deviations of
both the coupling strengths between Krylov states and their energy. We verify
their validity by inspecting two cases: Anderson localization as a function of
dimension and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body dipolar spin
system. We finally investigate the Wigner surmise and the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis, which have both been proposed to characterize
quantum chaotic systems. We show that when the average value of the
non-diagonal terms in the Lanczos matrix is large compared to their
fluctuations and to the fluctuations of the energy expectation values, which
typically corresponds to delocalized quantum systems according to our criteria,
there can be level repulsion of eigen-energies (also known as spectral
rigidity), similar to that of the Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy levels; and
we also demonstrate that in the same regime, the expectation values of typical
local observables only weakly vary as a function of eigenstates, an important
condition for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Our demonstration
assumes that, in the chaotic regime, the observable is sufficiently diagonal in
the basis of Krylov states.

working principles for both reciprocal effects. Our analysis reveals quantum

thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate
expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager
reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises
in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition

                                        <span>  In this work, we present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the
ground states of a class of classically hard Hamiltonians. The mechanism of the
exponential speedup that appeared in our algorithm is different from all
existing quantum algorithms. The idea is to introduce a mapping $f:\text{
}\rho\rightarrow |\rho\rangle$ to use density matrices to represent pure
states. We show that this mapping makes sense by giving an efficient method to
obtain the information of $|\rho\rangle$ from measurements on $\rho$. Under
this mapping, the Lindblad master equation (LME) becomes a Schr\"odinger
equation with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which contains natural imaginary time
evolution. The steady state of the LME, therefore, corresponds to the ground
state of $L^\dag L$ with $L$ the Liouvillian operator of the LME. We show the
runtime of the LME has the $\mathcal{O}(log(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling with $\zeta$
the overlap between the initial state and the ground state compared with the
$\mathcal{O}(poly(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling in other algorithms. The Hamiltonians
$L^\dag L$ are guaranteed to be difficult for classical computers if we believe
the simulation of LME is difficult. Further, for any given local Hamiltonian
$H$ with known ground energy $E_0$, we give a polynomial-time classical
procedure to judge and solve whether there exists $L$ such that $H-E_0=L^\dag
L$. Later, We discuss and analyze several important aspects of the algorithm
including the non-linear dynamics that appeared in the algorithm.

physics as it ensures real energies for stable experimental realization of
non-Hermitian phenomena. In this work, we propose $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry as a
paradigm for designing rich families of higher-dimensional non-Hermitian states
with unique bulk, surface, hinge or corner dynamics. Through systematically
breaking or restoring $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in different sectors of a system,
we can selectively activate or manipulate the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)
in both the bulk and topological boundary states. Some fascinating phenomena
include the directional toggling of the NHSE, and the flow of boundary states
without chiral or dynamical pumping, developed from selective boundary NHSE.
Our results extend richly into 3D or higher, with more sophisticated interplay
with selective bulk and boundary NHSE and charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$)
symmetry. Based on non-interacting lattices, $\mathcal{PT}$-activated NHSEs can
be observed in various optical, photonic, electric and quantum platforms that
admit gain/loss and non-reciprocity.

                                        <span>  Distributing quantum entanglement between distant parties is a significant
but difficult task in quantum information science, as it can enable numerous
applications but suffers from exponential decay in the quantum channel. Quantum
repeater is one of the most promising approaches towards this goal. In a
quantum repeater protocol, it is essential that the entanglement generation
speed within each elementary link is faster than the memory decoherence rate,
to enable the scale-up of the quantum repeater by connecting neighboring
repeater segments. This stringent requirement has not been implemented over a
fiber of metropolitan scale so far. As a step towards this challenging goal, in
this work we experimentally realize multiplexing-enhanced generation of
heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over a 12km fiber. We excite the
memory modes in a multiplexed quantum memory successively to generate 280 pairs
of atom-photon quantum correlations with a train of photonic time-bin pulses
filling the long fiber. After successful detection of a heralding signal, the
excited memory mode can be identified and retrieved into idler photons on
demand with either fixed or variable storage time. With the multiplexing
enhancement, the heralding rate of atom-photon correlation can reach 1.95kHz,
and the ratio between the quantum correlation generation rate to memory
decoherence rate can be improved to 0.46 for a fiber length of 12km, which is
so far the best for long fiber length (>10km) to our knowledge. This work
therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of a
large-scale quantum repeater network.

                                        <span>  Determining the optimal fidelity for the transmission of quantum information
over noisy quantum channels is one of the central problems in quantum
information theory. Recently, [Berta-Borderi-Fawzi-Scholz, Mathematical
Programming, 2021] introduced an asymptotically converging semidefinite
programming hierarchy of outer bounds for this quantity. However, the size of
the semidefinite programs (SDPs) grows exponentially with respect to the level
of the hierarchy, thus making their computation unscalable. In this work, by
exploiting the symmetries in the SDP, we show that, for a fixed output
dimension of the quantum channel, we can compute the SDP in time polynomial
with respect to the level of the hierarchy and input dimension. As a direct
consequence of our result, the optimal fidelity can be approximated with an
accuracy of $\epsilon$ in $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, \text{input dimension})$
time.

traversable by a double trace deformation. After coupling the two asymptotic
boundaries of a maximally extended $(d+1)$ dimensional black brane geometry
with $U(1)$ conserved current operators, we find that the quantum matter
stress-energy tensor of the corresponding bulk gauge fields in the hydrodynamic
limit violates the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), rendering the
wormhole traversable. Applying our results to axionic two-sided black hole
solutions, we discuss how the wormhole opening depends on the charge diffusion
constant, how this affects the amount of information that can be sent through
the wormhole, and possible implications for many-body quantum teleportation
protocols involving conserved current operators.

an ensemble, when only one state can be queried at a time. In the classical
case, it is well known that the optimal strategy trivially consists of querying
the states in their non-increasing order of posterior probability. In the
quantum case, on the other hand, the most general strategy to obtain the
optimal ordering in which to perform the queries consist of a quantum
measurement. Here, we solve such an optimization problem by deriving the
quantum measurement attaining the guesswork for a broad class of ensembles and
cost functions.

crucial role in both foundational physics and advanced quantum technologies.
Fully characterizing them poses a key scientific challenge. Here, we propose a
theoretical approach to achieving the complete tomography of biphotons by
introducing a frequency shift in one arm of the combination interferometer. Our
method, a generalized combination interferometer, enables the reconstruction of
the full complex joint spectral amplitude associated with both frequency sum
and difference in a single interferometer. In contrast, the generalized
Hong-Ou-Mandel and N00N state interferometers only allow for the partial
tomography of biphotons, either in frequency difference or frequency sum. This
provides an alternative method for full characterization of an arbitrary
two-photon state with exchange symmetry and holds potential for applications in
high-dimensional quantum information processing.

                                        <span>  We develop a quasiparticle approach to capture the dynamics of open quantum
systems coupled to bosonic thermal baths of arbitrary complexity based on the
Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). This is done by generalizing the HEOM
dynamics and mapping it into that of the system in interaction with a few
bosonic fictitious quasiparticles that we call bexcitons. Bexcitons arise from
a decomposition of the bath correlation function into discrete features.
Specifically, bexciton creation and annihilation couple the auxiliary density
matrices in the HEOM. The approach provides a systematic strategy to construct
exact quantum master equations that include the system-bath coupling to all
orders even for non-Markovian environments. Specifically, by introducing
different metrics and representations for the bexcitons it is possible to
straightforwardly generate different variants of the HEOM, demonstrating that
all these variants share a common underlying quasiparticle picture. Bexcitonic
properties, while unphysical, offer a coarse-grained view of the correlated
system-bath dynamics and its numerical convergence. For instance, we use it to
analyze the instability of the HEOM when the bath is composed of underdamped
oscillators and show that it leads to the creation of highly excited bexcitons.
The bexcitonic picture can also be used to develop more efficient approaches to
propagate the HEOM. As an example, we use the particle-like nature of the
bexcitons to introduce mode-combination of bexcitons that uses the
multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree to efficiently propagate the HEOM
dynamics.

effective Hamiltonian of a driven system are central to quantum technology.
However, the perturbative expansions used to derive static effective models may
not be able to efficiently capture all the relevant physics of the original
system. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the validity of the
usual low-order static effective Hamiltonian used to describe a Kerr oscillator
under a squeezing drive. This system is of fundamental and technological
interest. In particular, it has been used to stabilize Schr\"odinger cat
states, which have applications for quantum computing. We compare the states
and energies of the effective static Hamiltonian with the exact Floquet states
and quasi-energies of the driven system and determine the parameter regime
where the two descriptions agree. Our work brings to light the physics that is
left out by ordinary static effective treatments and that can be explored by
state-of-the-art experiments.

                                        <span>  Using quantum systems with more than two levels, or qudits, can scale the
computation space of quantum processors more efficiently than using qubits,
which may offer an easier physical implementation for larger Hilbert spaces.
However, individual qudits may exhibit larger noise, and algorithms designed
for qubits require to be recompiled to qudit algorithms for execution. In this
work, we implemented a two-qubit emulator using a 4-level superconducting
transmon qudit for variational quantum algorithm applications and analyzed its
noise model. The major source of error for the variational algorithm was
readout misclassification error and amplitude damping. To improve the accuracy
of the results, we applied error-mitigation techniques to reduce the effects of
the misclassification and qudit decay event. The final predicted energy value
is within the range of chemical accuracy. Our work demonstrates that qudits are
a practical alternative to qubits for variational algorithms.

                                        <span>  Quantum transducers convert quantum signals through hybrid interfaces of
physical platforms in quantum networks. Modeled as quantum communication
channels, performance of unidirectional quantum transduction can be measured by
the quantum channel capacity. However, characterizing performance of quantum
transducers used for duplex quantum transduction where signals are converted
bidirectionally remains an open question. Here, we propose rate regions to
characterize the performance of duplex quantum transduction. Using this tool,
we find that quantum transducers optimized for simultaneous duplex transduction
can outperform strategies based on the standard protocol of time-shared
unidirectional transduction. Integrated over the frequency domain, we
demonstrate that rate region can also characterize quantum transducers with
finite bandwidth.

                                        <span>  We examine a quantum Otto engine using both Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC)
and normal Bose gas as working medium trapped in generalized external
potential. We treated the engine quasi-statically and endoreversibly. Since the
expansion and compression in both quasi-static and endoreversible take place
isentropic, the expression of efficiency is similar. However, the power output
in the quasi-static cycle is zero due to infinite and long stroke time. In
contrast, with an endoreversible cycle, thermalization with two reservoirs
takes place at a finite time. We use Fourier's law in conduction to formulate
the relation between temperature of medium and reservoir, making work depend on
heating and cooling stroke time. Moreover, we maximized the power with respect
to compression ratio $\kappa$ to obtain efficiency at maximum power (EMP). We
found that EMP is significantly higher when using BEC as a working medium,
meanwhile EMP with normal Bose gas is just Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. We also
investigate the effect of thermal contact time $\tau$ with hot $(\tau_{h})$ and
cold $(\tau_{l})$ reservoir on EMP. We found that when complete thermalization,
$\tau_{h}=\tau_{l}$, stroke time occurs, there are no significant differences.
Nevertheless, while incomplete thermalization arise, by adjusting various
cooling and heating stroke time, provides a significant result on EMP, which is
much higher at $\tau_{h}<\tau_{l}$ stroke time whilst lower at
$\tau_{h}>\tau_{l}$ stroke time. We conclude this incomplete thermalization
leads to the condition where residual coherence emerges which enhances the EMP
of the engine.

potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we
formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles
by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath
particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential
equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We
demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat
bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the
one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries,
i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the
(retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the
various one-particle quantum states.

                                        <span>  Quantum circuit transformation aims to produce equivalent circuits while
optimizing for various aspects such as circuit depth, gate count, and
compatibility with modern Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based
approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity
unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as
Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to
find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search
space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques
such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we
propose AltGraph, a novel search-based circuit transformation approach that
generates equivalent quantum circuits using existing generative graph models.
We use three main graph models: DAG Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE) with two
variants: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and
Deep Generative Model for Graphs (DeepGMG) that take a Direct Acyclic Graph
(DAG) of the quantum circuit as input and output a new DAG from which we
reconstruct the equivalent quantum circuit. Next, we perturb the latent space
to generate equivalent quantum circuits some of which may be more compatible
with the hardware coupling map and/or enable better optimization leading to
reduced gate count and circuit depth. AltGraph achieves on average a 37.55%
reduction in the number of gates and a 37.75% reduction in the circuit depth
post-transpiling compared to the original transpiled circuit with only 0.0074
Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the density matrix.

is crucial for integrated quantum technology. In particular, converting
information between continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) devices
enables many applications in quantum networking, quantum sensing, quantum

CV-encoded information between CV and DV devices. We present a
resource-efficient method for encoding CV states and implementing CV gates on
DV devices, as well as two measurement-based protocols for transferring CV
states between CV and DV devices. The success probability of the transfer
protocols depends on the measurement outcome and can be increased to
near-deterministic values by adding ancillary qubits to the DV devices.

                                        <span>  We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a
$(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical
vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the
existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the
time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory
contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem
provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit,
where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of
quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral
limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total
flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states
into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We
demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely
flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component
into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization
of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the
lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the
magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to
prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic
field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The
topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic
practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems
including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.

                                        <span>  BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric
structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant
fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a
representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined
as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The
well-known wall-crossing phenomena is that the fixed point spectrum establishes
a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping
abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space
into a collection of stability chambers -- "phases" of the theory. The standard
construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal
model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the
same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of
the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its
representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian
$\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal
construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases
(chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them \emph{glasses} and also divide in
a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an
algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian
$\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an
earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as the
new wall-crossing invariants.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we develop a systematic way to characterize the 't Hooft
anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the
environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type.
By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we
incorporate them in a unified framework and calculate their anomalies. In the
case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry
and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are
classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial
dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we
generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases
as long as the weak symmetry is imposed.
  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy
physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time
dynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems.
Notably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state
shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous
symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We
discuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such
unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of
the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D
and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state
symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge
theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.

of interest in nature and technology; ranging from the exchange of energy and
matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle numbers
through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling
of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the
time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional
constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of
particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a
case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for
numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we discuss
complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying numbers of particles
inspired by different specific numerical goals and provide a generalized
equation that embeds all of them.

shuttles moving at hypersonic speed, not only mechanical collisions are
affecting the gas flow, but also chemical reactions have an impact on such
hypersonic flows. In this work we insert chemical reactions, in form of
dissociations and recombinations (associations), in an existing model for a
mixture of mono- and polyatomic (non-reacting) species. More general chemical
reactions, e.g., bimolecular ones, can be obtained by instant combinations of
associations and dissociations. The polyatomicity is modelled by a continuous
internal energy variable and the evolution of the gas is described by a
Boltzmann equation.
  In, e.g., the Chapman-Enskog process - and related half-space problems - the
linearized Boltzmann collision operator plays a central role. Here we extend
some important properties of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator to the
introduced model with chemical reactions. A compactness result, stating that
the linearized operator can be decomposed into a sum of a positive
multiplication operator - the collision frequency - and a compact integral
operator, is proven under reasonable assumptions on the collision kernel. The
strategy is to show that the terms of the integral operator are (at least)
uniform limits of Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators and therefore also compact
operators. Self-adjointness of the linearized operator is a direct
consequences. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision
frequency are obtained for hard sphere like, as well as hard potentials with
cutoff like models. As consequence, Fredholmness, as well as, the domain, of
the linearized collision operator are obtained

                                        <span>  We study the relation between large N instantons and conventional instantons,
focusing on matrix models and topological strings. We show that the resurgent
properties of the perturbative series at fixed but arbitrary N, including the
replica limit N = 0, can be obtained from large N instantons. In the case of
topological strings, it has been conjectured that the resurgent structure
encoded by large N instantons is closely related to the spectrum of BPS states.
We give direct evidence for this connection in the case of Seiberg-Witten
theory and other topological string models, and we show in detail how the
resurgent properties at fixed N follow from the large N theory, and therefore
can be used to obtain information on BPS invariants.

one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator for a particular periodic potential and
for its restriction to a finite number of sites. We deduce from this finite,
but large, number of sites, the Integrated Density of States (IDS) associated
to the Hamiltonian operator whose derivate is the DOS. The exact formula for
the IDS is given and the expression of the DOS is analytical. All our
calculations are done on the particular periodic Airy-potential, which is a new
case for which one has an analytical expression of the DOS. It is a continuous,
periodic potential, piecewise affine. As a periodic operator, the spectrum is a
band spectrum.

                                        <span>  In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in
kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent
system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as
self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social
network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which
modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We
then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its
large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for
the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and
is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the
graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing
the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon
structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided the show the
effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering
the system towards a declustered state.

scattering matrices defined via the standard intertwining operators for the
spherical principal representations of the isometry group are either given as
poles of the intertwining operators or as quantum resonances, i.e. poles of the
meromorphically continued resolvents of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We
extend this result to classical locally symmetric spaces of negative curvature
with convex-cocompact fundamental group using results of Bunke and Olbrich. The
method of proof forces us to exclude the spectral parameters corresponding to
singular Poisson transforms.

spin-orbit in the semi-classical regime $\hbar\searrow 0$ and large spin number
$\spin\rightarrow +\infty$ such that $\hbar^\delta\spin=c$ where $c>0$ and
$\delta>0$ are constant. The initial state $\Psi(0)$ is a product of an orbital
coherent state in $L^2(\R^d)$ and a spin coherent state in a spin irreducible
representation space ${\mathcal H}_{2\spin +1}$. For $\delta <1$, at the
leading order in $\hbar$, the time evolution $\Psi(t)$ of $ \Psi(0)$ is well
approximated by the product of an orbital and a spin coherent state.
Nevertheless for $1/2<\delta<1$ the quantum orbital leaves the classical
orbital. For $\delta=1$ we prove that this last claim is no more true when the
interaction depends on the orbital variables.
  For the Dicke model, we prove that the orbital partial trace of the projector
on $\Psi(t)$ is a mixed state in $L^2(\R)$ for small $t>0$.

which Alice aims to decouple her system from the environment by local
operations and discarding some of her systems. To achieve an
$\varepsilon$-decoupling with trace distance as the error criterion, we
establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization for the largest dimension of
the remainder system in terms of the conditional
$(1-\varepsilon)$-hypothesis-testing entropy. When the underlying system is
independent and identically prepared, our result leads to the matched
second-order rate as well as the matched moderate deviation rate. As an
application, we find an achievability bound in entanglement distillation
protocol, where the objective is for Alice and Bob to transform their quantum
state to maximally entangled state with largest possible dimension using only
local operations and one-way classical communications.

of order higher than two and their singularity structures. The higher order
mappings we use in this study are all obtained by coupling mappings that are
integrable through spectral methods, typically belonging to the QRT family, to
a variety of linearisable ones. We show that by judiciously choosing these
linearisable mappings, it is possible to obtain higher order mappings that
exhibit the maximal degree growth compatible with integrability, i.e. for which
the degree grows as a polynomial of order equal to the order of the mapping. In
all the cases we analysed, we found that maximal degree growth was associated
with the existence of an unconfining singularity pattern. Several cases with
submaximal growth but which still possess unconfining singularity patterns are
also presented. In many cases the exact degrees of the iterates of the mappings
were obtained by applying a method due to Halburd, based on the preimages of
specific values that appear in the singularity patterns of the mapping, but we
also present some examples where such a calculation appears to be impossible.

the data in classical spaces for the initial-boundary-value problem of the
diffusion equation on the half-line, with data that are not necessarily
compatible at the quadrant corner. This is based on a recent approach to
rigorously analyzing integral representations derived via the unified transform
method of Fokas. No exotic phenomena were discovered in this case, yet our
findings appear to be new in the pertinent literature. These results supplement
our previous investigations on existence and (non)uniqueness within the
framework of well-posedness. The present detailed exposition elucidates the
subtleties involved while also demonstrating a generic technique. Applications
of the latter to several other IBVPs and PDEs will be reported elsewhere.

for $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},\mathbb{O}$ of semi-simple Lie
algebras can be extended by including the sextonions $\mathbb{S}$. A series of
non-reductive Lie algebras naturally appear in the new row associated with the
sextonions, which we will call the \textit{intermediate exceptional series},
with the largest one as the intermediate Lie algebra $E_{7+1/2}$ constructed by
Landsberg--Manivel. We study various aspects of the intermediate vertex
operator (super)algebras associated with the intermediate exceptional series,
including rationality, coset constructions, irreducible modules,
(super)characters and modular linear differential equations. For all
$\mathfrak{g}_I$ belonging to the intermediate exceptional series, the
intermediate VOA $L_1(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ has characters of irreducible modules
coinciding with those of the simple rational $C_2$-cofinite $W$-algebra
$W_{-h^\vee/6}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ studied by Kawasetsu, with $\mathfrak{g}
$ belonging to the Cvitanovi\'c--Deligne exceptional series. We propose some
new intermediate VOA $L_k(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ with integer level $k$ and
investigate their properties. For example, for the intermediate Lie algebra
$D_{6+1/2}$ between $D_6$ and $E_7$ in the subexceptional series and also in
Vogel's projective plane, we find that the intermediate VOA $L_2(D_{6+1/2})$
has a simple current extension to a SVOA with four irreducible Neveu--Schwarz
modules. We also provide some (super) coset constructions such as
$L_2(E_7)/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ and $L_1(D_{6+1/2})^{\otimes2}\!/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$. In
the end, we find that the theta blocks associated with the intermediate
exceptional series produce some new holomorphic Jacobi forms of critical weight
and lattice index.

class-dependent couplings and magnetic fields. We prove that the

equation. In absence of magnetic fields, a phase transition is identified and
the corresponding critical parameters are determined by the spectral radius of
a low-dimensional matrix.

                                        <span>  For nonlinear Cosserat elasticity, we consider multiscale methods in this
paper. In particular, we explore the generalized multiscale finite element
method (GMsFEM) to solve an isotropic Cosserat problem with strain-limiting
property (ensuring bounded linearized strains even under high stresses). Such
strain-limiting Cosserat model can find potential applications in solids and
biological fibers. However, Cosserat media with naturally rotational degrees of
freedom, nonlinear constitutive relations, high contrast, and heterogeneities
may produce challenging multiscale characteristics in the solution, and
upscaling by multiscale methods is necessary. Therefore, we utilize the offline
and residual-based online (adaptive or uniform) GMsFEM in this context while
handling the nonlinearity by Picard iteration. Through various two-dimensional
experiments (for perforated, composite, and stochastically heterogeneous media
with small and big strain-limiting parameters), our numerical results show the
approaches' convergence, efficiency, and robustness. In addition, these results
demonstrate that such approaches provide good accuracy, the online GMsFEM gives
more accurate solutions than the offline one, and the online adaptive strategy
has similar accuracy to the uniform one but with fewer degrees of freedom.

of Lie and Courant algebroids over Lie groupoids. By relying on supergeometry,
we view these structures as instances of vector fields on graded groupoids
which are homological up to homotopy. We describe such vector fields in general
from two complementary viewpoints: firstly, as Maurer-Cartan elements in a
differential graded Lie algebra of multivector fields and, secondly, we also
view them from a categorical approach, in terms of functors and natural
transformations. Thereby, we obtain a unifying conceptual framework for
studying LA-groupoids, $L_2$-algebroids (including semistrict Lie 2-algebras
and 2-term representations up to homotopy), infinitesimal gerbe
prequantizations, higher gauge theory (specifically, 2-connections on
2-bundles), quasi-Poisson groupoids and (twisted) multiplicative Courant
algebroids.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we revisit the Kaluza-Klein theory from the perspective of the
classification of elementary particles based on the coadjoint orbit method. We
study the momentum map of the corresponding symmetry group $G_1$ which
conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the electric charge is not
frame-invariant, in contradiction with the experimental observations. In other
words, it is not the symmetry group of the Universe today as we know it. To
avert this paradox, we scale the fifth coordinate and consider the limit when
the cylinder radius vanishes. For the corresponding group $G_0$, the charge is
invariant. On this ground, we propose a cosmological scenario in which the
elementary particles of the early Universe are classified from the momenta of
the group $G_1$, next the three former dimensions inflate quickly while the
fifth one shrinks, leading to the 4D era in which as today the particles are
characterized by the momenta of the group $G_0$. By this mechanism, the
elementary particles can acquire electric charge as a by-product of the 4 + 1
symmetry breaking of the Universe. This work opens the way to the geometric
quantization of charged elementary particles. We construct the corresponding
$G_0$-connections by pullback on the space-time. Imposing that the linear
5-momentum is parallel-transported, we recover the conservation of the charge
and the equation of motion with Lorentz force. We revisit the variational
relativity and obtain the field equations for both the gravitation and
electromagnetic interactions with coupling terms which are negligible at the
Newtonian approximation, allowing to recover Maxwell equations.

parameter $t$ in the $x$- and $y$-directions and a possibly different hopping
parameter $t_z$ in the $z$-direction; this model interpolates between the 2D
and 3D Hubbard models corresponding to the limiting cases $t_z=0$ and $t_z=t$,
respectively. We first derive all-order asymptotic expansions for the density
of states. Using these expansions and units such that $t=1$, we analyze how the
N\'eel temperature and the antiferromagnetic mean field depend on the coupling
parameter, $U$, and on the hopping parameter $t_z$. We derive asymptotic
formulas valid in the weak coupling regime, and we study in particular the
transition from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional model as $t_z \to
0$. It is found that the asymptotic formulas are qualitatively different for
$t_z = 0$ (the two-dimensional case) and $t_z > 0$ (the case of nonzero hopping
in the $z$-direction). Our results show that certain universality features of
the three-dimensional Hubbard model are lost in the limit $t_z \to 0$ in which
the three-dimensional model reduces to the two-dimensional model.

                                        <span>  Quantum many-body scars are highly excited eigenstates of non-integrable
Hamiltonians which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and are
embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. We provide a general mechanism to
construct partially integrable models with arbitrarily large local Hilbert
space dimensions, which host exact many-body scars. We introduce designed
integrability-breaking terms to several exactly solvable spin chains, whose
integrable Hamiltonians are composed of the generators of the Temperley-Lieb
algebra. In the non-integrable subspace of these models, we identify a special
kind of product states -- the generalized spin helix states as exact quantum
many-body scars, which lie in the common null space of the non-Hermitian
generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and are annihilated by the
integrability-breaking terms. Our constructions establish an intriguing
connection between integrability and quantum many-body scars, meanwhile provide
a systematic understanding of scarred Hamiltonians from the perspective of
non-Hermitian projectors.

interacting with a degenerate Fermi gas, at zero temperature. First, we analyze
the mean-field approximation of the many-body Schr\"odinger dynamics and prove
emergence of a coupled Hartree-type system of equations. We obtain rigorous
error control that yields a non-trivial scaling window in which the
approximation is meaningful. Second, starting from this Hartree system, we
identify a novel scaling regime in which the fermion distribution behaves
semi-clasically, but the boson field remains quantum-mechanical; this is one of
the main contributions of the present article. In this regime, the bosons are
much lighter and more numerous than the fermions. We then prove convergence to
a coupled Vlasov-Hartee system of equations with an explicit convergence rate.

                                        <span>  The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a
quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In
this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver
is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an
error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message
conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting
postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the
postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter
characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement
assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing
that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a
variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so
by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower
bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper
bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As
such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even
when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on
communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike
curves.

isomonodromy equations, which can be seen as a higher-dimensional
generalization of Painlev\'e VI. We first construct its convergent $n\times n$
matrix series solutions satisfying certain boundary condition. We then use the
Riemann-Hilbert approach to prove that the resulting solutions are almost all
the solutions. Along the way, we find a shrinking phenomenon of the eigenvalues
of the submatrices of the generic matrix solutions in the long time behaviour.

with complex eigenvalues in $N\times N$ non-Hermitian random Gaussian matrices.
In well known works by Chalker and Mehlig the expectation of this
(self-)overlap was computed for the complex Ginibre ensemble as $N\to \infty$.
In the present work, we consider the same quantity in the real and complex
elliptic Ginibre ensembles characterized by correlations between off-diagonal
entries controlled by a parameter $\tau\in[0,1]$, with $\tau=1$ corresponding
to the Hermitian limit. We derive exact expressions for the mean diagonal
overlap in both ensembles at any finite $N$, for any eigenvalue off the real
axis. We further investigate several scaling regimes as $N\rightarrow \infty$,
both in the limit of strong non-Hermiticity keeping a fixed $\tau\in[0,1)$ and
in the weak non-Hermiticity limit, with $\tau$ approaching unity in such a way
that $N(1-\tau)$ remains finite.

                                        <span>  We study the higher spin algebras of two-dimensional conformal field theory
from the perspective of quantum integrability. Starting from Maulik-Okounkov
instanton R-matrix and applying the procedure of algebraic Bethe ansatz, we
obtain infinite commuting families of Hamiltonians of quantum ILW hierarchy
parametrized by the shape of the auxiliary torus. We calculate explicitly the
first five of these Hamiltonians. Then, we numerically verify that their joint
spectrum can be parametrized by solutions of Litvinov's Bethe ansatz equations
and we conjecture a general formula for the joint spectrum of all ILW
Hamiltonians, based on results of Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin.
  There are two interesting degeneration limits, the infinitely thick and the
infinitely thin auxiliary torus. In one of these limits, the ILW hierarchy
degenerates to Yangian or Benjamin-Ono hierarchy and the Bethe equations can be
easily solved. The other limit is singular but we can nevertheless extract
local Hamiltonians corresponding to quantum KdV or KP hierarchy. Litvinov's
Bethe equations in this local limit provide an alternative to Bethe ansatz
equations of Bazhanov, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov, but are more transparent,
work at any rank and are manifestly symmetric under triality symmetry of
$\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$. Finally, we illustrate analytic properties of the
solutions of Bethe equations in minimal models, in particular for Lee-Yang CFT.
The analytic structure of Bethe roots is very rich as it captures the
representation theory of $\mathcal{W}_N$ minimal models.

position of a test particle. The proposed 'velocity kick' memory effect,
supposedly discovered recently, is in contradiction to these findings. We show
that the 'velocity kick' memory is an artefact resulting from an unjustified
interchange of limits. This example is a warning against drawing uncritical
conclusions for spacetime fields, from their asymptotic behavior.

                                        <span>  We look into the problem of stochastic resetting with refractory periods. The
model dynamics comprises diffusive and motionless phases. The diffusive phase
ends at random time instants, at which the system is reset to a given position
-- where the system remains at rest for a random time interval, termed the
refractory period. A pathway formulation is introduced to derive exact
analytical results for the relevant observables in a broad framework, with the
resetting time and the refractory period following arbitrary distributions. For
the paradigmatic case of Poissonian distributions of the resetting and
refractory times, in general with different characteristic rates, closed-form
expressions are obtained that successfully describe the relaxation to the
steady state. Finally, we focus on the single-target search problem, in which
the survival probability and the mean first passage time to the target can be
exactly computed. Therein, we also discuss optimal strategies, which show a
non-trivial dependence on the refractory period.

                                        <span>  We prove that the motion of a single hole induces $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in
the $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ (Fermi) Hubbard model on a Husimi-like tree graph. The
result is also generalized to certain $t$-$J$ models with antiferromagnetic
interactions and singlet hopping terms typically neglected in the literature.
This is an $SU(N)$ generalization of the "counter-Nagaoka theorem" introduced
in [Phys. Rev. B 107, L140401 (2023)]. Our results suggest the existence of
antiferromagnetic or resonating-valence-bond (RVB)-like polarons in the $t$-$J$
models on a more realistic non-bipartite lattice. Such antiferromagnetic/RVB
polarons may be relevant for a novel strong-coupling mechanism of
superconductivity or other exotic fractionalized phases of matter.

Bose-Einstein quantum gases, which contains the first order contribution due to
the quantum nature of the gas particles. Then, we analyze the fundamental
equation in the context of geometrothermodynamics. Although the corresponding
Hamiltonian does not contain a potential, indicating the lack of classical
thermodynamic interaction, we show that the curvature of the equilibrium space
is non-zero and can be interpreted as a measure of the effective quantum
interaction between the gas particles. In the limiting case of a classical
Boltzmann gas, we show that the equilibrium space becomes flat, as expected
from the physical viewpoint. In addition, we derive a thermodynamic fundamental
equation for the Bose-Einstein condensation and, using the Ehrenfest scheme, we
show that it can be considered as a first order phase transition which in the
equilibrium space corresponds to a curvature singularity. This result indicates
that the curvature of the equilibrium space can be used to measure in an
invariant way the thermodynamic interaction in classical and quantum ideal
gases.

                                        <span>  We present a novel background-independent framework for cosmic inflation,
starting with a matrix model. In this framework, inflation is portrayed as a
dynamic process responsible for the generation of both space and time. This
stands in contrast to conventional inflation, which is characterized as a mere
(exponential) expansion of an already existing spacetime, driven by the vacuum
energy associated with an inflaton field. We observe that the cosmic inflation
is triggered by the condensate of Planck energy into vacuum and responsible for
the dynamical emergence of spacetime. The emergent spacetime picture admits a
background-independent formulation so that the inflation is described by a
conformal Hamiltonian system which requires neither an inflaton field nor an ad
hoc inflation potential. This implies that the emergent spacetime may
incapacitate all the rationales to introduce the multiverse hypothesis.

                                        <span>  We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a
$(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical
vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the
existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the
time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory
contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem
provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit,
where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of
quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral
limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total
flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states
into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We
demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely
flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component
into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization
of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the
lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the
magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to
prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic
field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The
topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic
practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems
including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.

                                        <span>  BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric
structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant
fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a
representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined
as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The
well-known wall-crossing phenomena is that the fixed point spectrum establishes
a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping
abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space
into a collection of stability chambers -- "phases" of the theory. The standard
construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal
model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the
same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of
the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its
representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian
$\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal
construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases
(chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them \emph{glasses} and also divide in
a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an
algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian
$\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an
earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as the
new wall-crossing invariants.

scalarized black holes, as well as investigate how a Ricci coupling influences
them. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the Kerr metric in terms
of the location and geodesic frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit
and light ring, with the former exhibiting more pronounced disparities. The
shadows of scalarized black holes exhibit relatively minor deviations when
compared to those of Kerr black holes with the same mass and spin. Overall, the
presence of a Ricci coupling is observed to mitigate deviations from the Kerr
metric.

                                        <span>  Previous work has given proof and evidence that BPS states in local
Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be described and counted by exponential networks on the
punctured plane, with the help of a suitable non-abelianization map to the
mirror curve. This provides an appealing elementary depiction of moduli of
special Lagrangian submanifolds, but so far only a handful of examples have
been successfully worked out in detail. In this note, we exhibit an explicit
correspondence between torus fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points on
$\mathbb C^2\subset\mathbb C^3$ and anomaly free exponential networks attached
to the quadratically framed pair of pants. This description realizes an
interesting, and seemingly novel, "age decomposition" of linear partitions. We
also provide further details about the networks' perspective on the full
D-brane moduli space.

                                        <span>  The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation
of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are
now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions,
incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense
discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of
total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations
of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions
cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the
treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral
formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of
interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a
new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids
the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of
the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating
by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We
explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space
variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations, and
we provide diagrammatic rules to systematically classify all possible
contributions. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of
Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic
terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for
performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation [...]. Being
already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of
primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear
dynamics of quantum states during inflation.

$U(N)$ SYM and their giant graviton expansion encoding finite $N$ corrections
to the large $N$ limit. We compute in closed form the single giant graviton
contribution to correlators with general insertions of $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS
charged Wilson lines. For the 2-point function with fundamental and
anti-fundamental Wilson lines, we match the result from fluctuations of two
half-infinite strings ending on the giant graviton, recently proposed in
arXiv:2403.11543. In particular, we prove exact factorization of the defect
contribution with respect to wrapped D3 brane fluctuations representing the
single giant graviton correction to the undecorated Schur index. This follows
from a finite-difference representation of the Schur line defect index in terms
of the index without defects, and similar factorization holds quite generally
for more complicated defect configurations. In particular, the single giant
graviton contribution to the 4-point function with two fundamental and two
anti-fundamental lines is computed and discussed in this perspective.

the perspective of classical bosonic closed string field theory (SFT). The
latter can be viewed as a version of Wilsonian renormalization group (RG)
improved conformal perturbation theory, where the renormalization scheme is
defined through the choice of string vertices in the construction of SFT.
Furthermore, the CFT data at the RG fixed point can be recovered from the
spectrum and amplitudes of string field fluctuations. As applications, we
construct the Horowitz-Polchinski "string star" solution in SFT, and a solution
of tachyon-dilaton condensation that deforms the noncompact boson to minimal
models by creating a pair of "Runkel-Watts walls".

                                        <span>  Previous work on black hole partition functions and entanglement entropy
suggests the existence of "edge" degrees of freedom living on the (stretched)
horizon. We identify a local and "shrinkable" boundary condition on the
stretched horizon that gives rise to such degrees of freedom. They can be
interpreted as the Goldstone bosons of gauge transformations supported on the
boundary, with the electric field component normal to the boundary as their
symplectic conjugate. Applying the covariant phase space formalism for
manifolds with boundary, we show that both the symplectic form and Hamiltonian
exhibit a bulk-edge split. We then show that the thermal edge partition
function is that of a codimension-two ghost compact scalar living on the
horizon. In the context of a de Sitter static patch, this agrees with the edge
partition functions found by Anninos et al. in arbitrary dimensions. It also
yields a 4D entanglement entropy consistent with the conformal anomaly.
Generalizing to Proca theory, we find that the prescription of Donnelly and
Wall reproduces existing results for its edge partition function, while its
classical phase space does not exhibit a bulk-edge split.

and self-dual gravity manifestly satisfy color-kinematics duality at the level
of action. In a similar way color-kinematics duality also holds for a scalar
field minimally coupled to a self-dual Yang-Mills field and self-dual gravity.
By applying the appropriate limiting procedure to these scalar field theories,
we reproduce point particle theories we started from. This allows us to connect
worldline color-kinematics duality to amplitude color-kinematics duality in
field theory. Considering that point particles act as sources of classical
solutions, our results may be regarded as a step towards establishing a precise
relation between the amplitude and the classical double copies in the self-dual
sector. Finally, we briefly mention that the extension of this discussion to
the higher-spin case suggests that scalar point particles cannot interact with
chiral higher-spin fields.

                                        <span>  We derive the soft effective action in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge
theories from the on-shell action obeying Neumann boundary conditions at
timelike and null infinity and Dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial
infinity. This allows us to identify the on-shell degrees of freedom on the
boundary with the soft modes living on the celestial sphere. Following the work
of Donnelly and Wall, this suggests that we can interpret soft modes as
entanglement edge modes on the celestial sphere and study entanglement
properties of soft modes in abelian gauge theories.

supersymmetric dual gauge theories on $S_b^3/\mathbb{Z}_r$ in the context of
the gauge/YBE correspondence. We consider hyperbolic hypergeometric integral
identities acquired via the equality of supersymmetric lens partition functions
as solutions to the decoration transformation and the flipping relation in
statistical mechanics. The solutions of those transformations aim at
investigating various decorated lattice models possessing the Boltzmann weights
of integrable Ising-like models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. We
also constructed The Bailey pairs for the decoration transformation and the
flipping relation.

                                        <span>  We compute the 1-loop vertex function of the QCD coupling in the presence of
an ultra intense magnetic field. From the vertex function, we extract the
effective coupling and show that it grows with increasing magnetic field. We
consider the quark-gluon vertex and the three-gluon vertex, accounting for the
propagators of charged particles within the loops using the lowest Landau level
approximation in order to satisfy the condition where the magnetic field is the
largest energy scale. Under this approximation, we find that the contribution
from the three-gluon vertex vanishes. Therefore, this result arises from the
competition between the color charge associated to gluons and to quarks as
well, with the former being larger than the latter. The behavior of the QCD
coupling as a function of the magnetic field strength is analogous to that
exhibited by the light-quark condensate, indicating the magnetic catalysis
occurs. This increasing behavior stems from the dominant contribution of color
charge associated to gluons in the vertex function.

focusing on matrix models and topological strings. We show that the resurgent
properties of the perturbative series at fixed but arbitrary N, including the
replica limit N = 0, can be obtained from large N instantons. In the case of
topological strings, it has been conjectured that the resurgent structure
encoded by large N instantons is closely related to the spectrum of BPS states.
We give direct evidence for this connection in the case of Seiberg-Witten
theory and other topological string models, and we show in detail how the
resurgent properties at fixed N follow from the large N theory, and therefore
can be used to obtain information on BPS invariants.

                                        <span>  Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator
complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos
coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity
growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the
Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose
the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak
ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic
regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly
ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a
collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking
leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of
different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We
test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East
model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak
ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on
the Krylov chain.

renormalisable versions having tensors with many degrees of freedom. $16_H$ is
the smallest representation, participates in Yukawa Lagrangian at the
non-renormalisable level, contributing to the charged and neutral fermion
masses, and has six distinct scalars with different $B-L$ charges. We computed
the leptoquark and diquark couplings of different pairs of scalars stemming
from all possible decomposition of the term resulting from the coupling of
$16_{\rm{H}}$ with the $\mathbf{16}$ dimensional fermion multiplet of $SO(10)$,
i.e. $\frac{\mathbf{16}\,\mathbf{16}\,16_{\rm{H}}\,16_{\rm{H}}}{\Lambda}$.
Computing the tree and loop level contribution of different pairs to the
effective dimension six, $B-L$ conserving operators, it turns out only three
pairs, viz $\sigma\big(1,1,0\big)- T\big(3,1,\frac{1}{3}\big)$, and
$H\big(1,2,-\frac{1}{2}\big)-\Delta\big(3,2,\frac{1}{6}\big)$, and $H-T$ can
induce proton decay at tree level. Assuming that the Yukawa couplings of the
$16_{\rm{H}}$ are comparable to those of the $\overline{126}_{\rm{H}}$ of a
realistic SO(10) model and setting the cutoff scale to the Planck scale
typically constrains the $B-L$ breaking scale to be $4\sim 5$ orders of
magnitude less than the cutoff scale $(\Lambda)$. Moreover, analysing the
branching pattern of the leading two-body decay modes of the proton, we
observed a preference for the proton to decay into second-generation mesons due
to the hierarchical nature of Yukawa couplings. In a realistic $SO(10)$
scenario, we find that $M_T >10^{8}$ TeV, while $M_\Delta$ could be as light as
a few TeV$s$.

for $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},\mathbb{O}$ of semi-simple Lie
algebras can be extended by including the sextonions $\mathbb{S}$. A series of
non-reductive Lie algebras naturally appear in the new row associated with the
sextonions, which we will call the \textit{intermediate exceptional series},
with the largest one as the intermediate Lie algebra $E_{7+1/2}$ constructed by
Landsberg--Manivel. We study various aspects of the intermediate vertex
operator (super)algebras associated with the intermediate exceptional series,
including rationality, coset constructions, irreducible modules,
(super)characters and modular linear differential equations. For all
$\mathfrak{g}_I$ belonging to the intermediate exceptional series, the
intermediate VOA $L_1(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ has characters of irreducible modules
coinciding with those of the simple rational $C_2$-cofinite $W$-algebra
$W_{-h^\vee/6}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ studied by Kawasetsu, with $\mathfrak{g}
$ belonging to the Cvitanovi\'c--Deligne exceptional series. We propose some
new intermediate VOA $L_k(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ with integer level $k$ and
investigate their properties. For example, for the intermediate Lie algebra
$D_{6+1/2}$ between $D_6$ and $E_7$ in the subexceptional series and also in
Vogel's projective plane, we find that the intermediate VOA $L_2(D_{6+1/2})$
has a simple current extension to a SVOA with four irreducible Neveu--Schwarz
modules. We also provide some (super) coset constructions such as
$L_2(E_7)/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ and $L_1(D_{6+1/2})^{\otimes2}\!/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$. In
the end, we find that the theta blocks associated with the intermediate
exceptional series produce some new holomorphic Jacobi forms of critical weight
and lattice index.

                                        <span>  At its core, hydrodynamics is a many-body low-energy effective theory for the
long-wavelength, long-timescale dynamics of conserved charges in systems close
to thermodynamic equilibrium. It has a wide range of applications spanning from
nuclear physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and more recently
strongly-interacting electronic phases of matter. In solid-state systems,
however, symmetries are often only approximate, and softly broken by the
presence of the lattice, impurities, and defects, or because the symmetry is
accidental. Therefore, the hydrodynamic regime must be expanded to include weak
non-conservation effects, which lead to a theory known as quasihydrodynamics.
In this thesis we make progress in understanding the theory of (quasi)
hydrodynamics, with a specific focus on applications to condensed matter
systems and their holographic description.

energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This
work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction
between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function
of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an
approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that
governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector
along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm
to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis
of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating
diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for
the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which
encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero
$\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit)
corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the
addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of
$\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This
study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear
cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of
constraints on the dark sector interaction.

approach and perspective for classifying black hole systems. In this work, we
explore the thermodynamical topology of the quantum BTZ black hole by employing
the concept of the generalized free energy. To fully characterize the
thermodynamics, we introduce two distinct topological numbers. The first one is
determined by an expression, denoted by $z$, derived from the free energy.
Although it can provide us with some local physical explanations, sufficient
physical significance still lacks from a global perspective. On the other hand,
the second topological number is based on the entropy expression of the
generalized free energy, leading to a more meaningful interpretation of its
physical implications. This result highlights the natural choice of entropy as
the domain variable for the generalized free energy. Regarding the second
topological number, our analysis reveals a topological transition that is
associated with the thermodynamical stability of the ``cold" black hole state
of the quantum BTZ black hole. Furthermore, our study suggests the existence of
topological numbers beyond the conventional values of $\pm 1,0$.

particle will deviate from the geodesic. Using the effective potential method,
we study the motion of a spinning test particle on the equatorial plane of a
polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity described by the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with minimal spin-gravity interaction. We
find that for the bounded orbits in the radial direction, the particle's motion
is timelike when its spin is small. The radial range of the orbit and its
eccentricity decrease with the loop quantum gravity parameter. However, when
the particle takes a large enough spin, we observe an interesting phenomenon
that the timelike and spacelike motions alternately appear while are separated
by a critical radius. Outside the critical radius, the motion is timelike,
however inside it is spacelike, and on the radius $r_c$ it is null. To explore
more observable effects of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of
the spinning particle, we focus our attention on the circular orbits,
particularly the innermost stable circular orbits, near the black hole. The
result shows that for the same spin, there are two different innermost stable
circular orbits, one with a larger radius and the other with a smaller radius.
Both the radii decrease as the loop quantum gravity parameter increases. More
significantly, with the increase of the spin of the particle, the small
innermost stable circular orbit transition from timelike to spacelike, while
the one with large radius does not. Instead, it terminates at a certain value
of spin. All the results present the significant influences of the loop quantum
gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particles.

show that they are broken at the leading order in bosonic correlation

model, created by extending the $\phi^4$ kink in an additional infinite
direction. Classically, the tension is $m^3/3\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the
coupling and $m$ is the meson mass. At order $O(\lambda^0)$ all ultraviolet
divergences can be removed by normal ordering, less trivial divergences arrive
only at the next order. This allows us to easily quantize the domain wall,
working at order $O(\lambda^0)$. We calculate the leading quantum correction to
its tension as a two-dimensional integral over a function which is determined
analytically. This integral is performed numerically, resulting in
$-0.0866m^2$. We also find, at this order, the excitation spectrum.

                                        <span>  Considering two antipodal observers in de Sitter space, we illustrate how
spacetime connectivity between the holographic screens located on the
(stretched) horizons emerges from holographic entanglement. To do so, we
construct a covariant holographic entanglement entropy prescription in de
Sitter space, including quantum corrections. While this prescription is
inspired by the bilayer proposal, we argue that the monolayer proposal appears
to be inconsistent. Entanglement wedge reconstruction implies an extension of
static patch holography where the exterior region connecting the static patches
is included, and reconstructible from the two screens. A phase transition
occurs where there is an exchange of dominance between two competing quantum
extremal surfaces, leading to a transfer of the encoding of the exterior region
from one screen to the other. The effects in the bulk of integrating out
degrees of freedom from the screens are discussed.

                                        <span>  We study non-holomorphic modular forms built from iterated integrals of
holomorphic modular forms for SL$(2,\mathbb Z)$ known as equivariant iterated
Eisenstein integrals. A special subclass of them furnishes an equivalent
description of the modular graph forms appearing in the low-energy expansion of
string amplitudes at genus one. Notably the Fourier expansion of modular graph
forms contains single-valued multiple zeta values. We deduce the appearance of
products and higher-depth instances of multiple zeta values in equivariant
iterated Eisenstein integrals, and ultimately modular graph forms, from the
appearance of simpler odd Riemann zeta values. This analysis relies on
so-called zeta generators which act on certain non-commutative variables in the
generating series of the iterated integrals. From an extension of these
non-commutative variables we incorporate iterated integrals involving
holomorphic cusp forms into our setup and use them to construct the modular
completion of triple Eisenstein integrals. Our work represents a fully explicit
realisation of the modular graph forms within Brown's framework of equivariant
iterated Eisenstein integrals and reveals structural analogies between
single-valued period functions appearing in genus zero and one string
amplitudes.

qualitatively and quantitatively similar to crystals observed in the standard

free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In
particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system
with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field
theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a
half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result
is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with
the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an
excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes
asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient
chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper
continuum limit.

                                        <span>  Holography relates gravitational theories in five dimensions to
four-dimensional quantum field theories in flat space. Under this map, the
equation of state of the field theory is encoded in the black hole solutions of
the gravitational theory. Solving the five-dimensional Einstein's equations to
determine the equation of state is an algorithmic, direct problem. Determining
the gravitational theory that gives rise to a prescribed equation of state is a
much more challenging, inverse problem. We present a novel approach to solve
this problem based on physics-informed neural networks. The resulting algorithm
is not only data-driven but also informed by the physics of the Einstein's
equations. We successfully apply it to theories with crossovers, first- and
second-order phase transitions.

                                        <span>  We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at
tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the
Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for
example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological
application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and
consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting
their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with
modified entanglement receive corrections.

of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both
classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of
open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can
lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that
allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the
appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the
non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in
the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our
proposed criterion.

                                        <span>  How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based
on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of
double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter
(LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in
arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete
complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions.
First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the
doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord
states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of
a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary
time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection
between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which
describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of
the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic
systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the
number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of
boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We
interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in
a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines
between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate
a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on
its possible dual manifestations.

quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In
this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver
is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an
error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message
conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting
postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the
postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter
characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement
assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing
that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a
variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so
by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower
bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper
bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As
such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even
when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on
communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike
curves.

gauge-boson--ghost vertex function are studied for SU(N), Sp(2N) and SO(N)
gauge groups. We solve a set of coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations in Landau
gauge for a variable, fractional number $N_f$ of massless fermions in the
fundamental representation. For large $N_f$ we find a phase transition from a
chirally broken into a chirally symmetric phase that is consistent with the
behavior expected inside the conformal window. Even in the presence of fermions
the gauge-boson--ghost-vertex dressing remains small. In the conformal window
this vertex shows the expected power law behavior. It does not assume its
tree-level value in the far infrared, but the respective dressing function is a
constant greater than one.

multi-scalar theories with hypercubic global symmetry. This includes working
out symmetry representations and their corresponding tensor structures. These
structures are then used to compute the anomalous dimensions of scalar
operators with up to four fields and arbitrary representations to six-loop
order. Moreover, we determine one-loop anomalous dimensions for a large number
of low-lying operators in the spectrum which include more powers of the
fundamental field and/or insertions of derivatives. As an aside we show how
projectors used in the conformal bootstrap can be conveniently reused in
computations of anomalous dimensions. The results of our study are of use to
the conformal bootstrap. They also illuminate features of conformal
perturbation theory and the large $n$ expansion. Our results may be of interest
for various crossover phenomena in statistical field theory. In total, we
compute the scaling dimension of more than 300 operators, of which 16 are
computed to six-loops. Our analysis is exhaustive with respect to group theory
up to rank 4 for any number of flavours $n$, and also exhaustive with respect
to which representations exist for $n \leq 4$.

                                        <span>  We study the higher spin algebras of two-dimensional conformal field theory
from the perspective of quantum integrability. Starting from Maulik-Okounkov
instanton R-matrix and applying the procedure of algebraic Bethe ansatz, we
obtain infinite commuting families of Hamiltonians of quantum ILW hierarchy
parametrized by the shape of the auxiliary torus. We calculate explicitly the
first five of these Hamiltonians. Then, we numerically verify that their joint
spectrum can be parametrized by solutions of Litvinov's Bethe ansatz equations
and we conjecture a general formula for the joint spectrum of all ILW
Hamiltonians, based on results of Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin.
  There are two interesting degeneration limits, the infinitely thick and the
infinitely thin auxiliary torus. In one of these limits, the ILW hierarchy
degenerates to Yangian or Benjamin-Ono hierarchy and the Bethe equations can be
easily solved. The other limit is singular but we can nevertheless extract
local Hamiltonians corresponding to quantum KdV or KP hierarchy. Litvinov's
Bethe equations in this local limit provide an alternative to Bethe ansatz
equations of Bazhanov, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov, but are more transparent,
work at any rank and are manifestly symmetric under triality symmetry of
$\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$. Finally, we illustrate analytic properties of the
solutions of Bethe equations in minimal models, in particular for Lee-Yang CFT.
The analytic structure of Bethe roots is very rich as it captures the
representation theory of $\mathcal{W}_N$ minimal models.

                                        <span>  We present a simple model which generates cosmological anisotropies on top of
standard FLRW geometry. This is in some sense reminiscent of the mean field
approximation, where the mean field cosmological model under consideration
would be the standard FLRW, and the anisotropy is a small perturbative
correction on top of it. Using a supergravity-inspired model, we confirm that
the stable fixed point of our model corresponds to standard FLRW cosmology. We
use a Bianchi VII$_0$-type model supplemented with a scalar and $U(1)$ gauge
fields, and we show that the anisotropies of the geometry are generated by the
non-trivial interaction between the gravity sector and the $U(1)$ gauge sector.
Studying the attractor flow, we show that the anisotropies are present at early
times (high redshift) and decay asymptotically to an FLRW attractor fixed
point. With such a mechanism, observations of non-isotropy are not
contradictory to FLRW geometry or indeed the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such models
could in principle shed some insights on the present cosmological tensions.

constant $H_0$ is an integration constant. Thus, consistency of the model
demands observational constancy of $H_0$. We demonstrate redshift evolution of
best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ in Pantheon+ supernove
(SNe). Redshift evolution of best fit cosmological parameters is a prerequisite
to finding a statistically significant evolution as well as identifying
alternative models that are competitive with $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model
comparison. To assess statistical significance, we employ three different
methods: i) Bayesian model comparison, ii) mock simulations and iii) profile
distributions. The first shows a marginal preference for the vanilla
$\Lambda$CDM model over an ad hoc model with 3 additional parameters and an
unphysical jump in cosmological parameters at $z=1$. From mock simulations, we
estimate the statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit
parameters and negative dark energy density ($\Omega_m > 1$) to be in the $1-2
\sigma$ range, depending on the criteria employed. Importantly, in direct
comparison to the same analysis with the earlier Pantheon sample we find that
statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters has
increased, as expected for a physical effect. Our profile distribution analysis
demonstrates a shift in $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ in excess of $95\%$ confidence level
for SNe with redshifts $z > 1$ and also shows that a degeneracy in MCMC
posteriors is not equivalent to a curve of constant $\chi^2$. Our findings can
be interpreted as a statistical fluctuation or unexplored systematics in
Pantheon+ or $\Lambda$CDM model breakdown. The first two possibilities are
disfavoured by similar trends in independent probes.

                                        <span>  A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order
to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained
attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity
bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski
gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the
language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into
$\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of
Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant
sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for
the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear
perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$,
associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the
addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient
conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these
functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation
$\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of
gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete
formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the
strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of
scalar-tensor theories.

                                        <span>  The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental
constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle
physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard
Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark
Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In
fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs
boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called
``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years.
We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and
indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the
nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale
(i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly
accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After
discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we
summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions.
In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates.
Discovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.

                                        <span>  Formulating non-Abelian gauge theories as a tensor network is known to be
challenging due to the internal degrees of freedom that result in the
degeneracy in the singular value spectrum. In two dimensions, it is
straightforward to 'trace out' these degrees of freedom with the use of
character expansion, giving a reduced tensor network where the degeneracy
associated with the internal symmetry is eliminated. In this work, we show that
such an index loop also exists in higher dimensions in the form of a closed
tensor network we call the 'armillary sphere'. This allows us to completely
eliminate the matrix indices and reduce the overall size of the tensors in the
same way as is possible in two dimensions. This formulation allows us to
include significantly more representations with the same tensor size, thus
making it possible to reach a greater level of numerical accuracy in the tensor
renormalization group computations.

boundaries of a maximally extended $(d+1)$ dimensional black brane geometry
with $U(1)$ conserved current operators, we find that the quantum matter
stress-energy tensor of the corresponding bulk gauge fields in the hydrodynamic
limit violates the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), rendering the
wormhole traversable. Applying our results to axionic two-sided black hole
solutions, we discuss how the wormhole opening depends on the charge diffusion
constant, how this affects the amount of information that can be sent through
the wormhole, and possible implications for many-body quantum teleportation

gravitational waves (GW), encoding the effects of interaction and
self-interaction in a time, frequency and polarization dependent effective
speed. In terms of an appropriately defined effective metric, the effective
action takes the form a massless Klein-Gordon action.
  This effective approach predicts that for theories with matter coupled to the
Einstein frame metric the ratio between gravitational and electromagnetic (EM)
luminosity distance depends on the effective speed, while for Jordan frame
matter coupling it depends on the effective Planck mass. We discuss how the
frequency and polarization dependence of the GW-EM distance ratio provides a
new test of general relativity and its modifications, and more in general of
the interaction of GWs with other fields.

of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet interaction in the four-dimensional Anti-de
Sitter-Schwarzchild black hole background. Pole skipping points are special
points in phase space where the bulk linearised differential equations have
multiple ingoing solutions. Those special points are claimed to be connected to
chaos. In this paper, we initiated a novel study on understanding the response
of those special points under the application of external sources. The source
is identified with the holographic dual operator of the bulk scalar field with
its non-normalizable solutions. We analyze in detail the dynamics of pole
skipping points in both sound and shear channels, considering linear
perturbation in bulk. In the perturbative regime, characteristic parameters for
chaos, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, remain unchanged.
However, the diffusion coefficient has evolved non-trivially under the external

                                        <span>  We present a novel background-independent framework for cosmic inflation,
starting with a matrix model. In this framework, inflation is portrayed as a
dynamic process responsible for the generation of both space and time. This
stands in contrast to conventional inflation, which is characterized as a mere
(exponential) expansion of an already existing spacetime, driven by the vacuum
energy associated with an inflaton field. We observe that the cosmic inflation
is triggered by the condensate of Planck energy into vacuum and responsible for
the dynamical emergence of spacetime. The emergent spacetime picture admits a
background-independent formulation so that the inflation is described by a
conformal Hamiltonian system which requires neither an inflaton field nor an ad
hoc inflation potential. This implies that the emergent spacetime may
incapacitate all the rationales to introduce the multiverse hypothesis.

                                        <span>  The quantization of Yang-Mills field theories requires the introduction of a
gauge fixing which leads to a violation of the Local Gauss Law described by the
so-called Gauss operator. We discuss the local quantizations of Yang-Mills
theories in terms of the possible Gauss operators, which are argued to have a
more physical meaning than the gauge fixings. We focus the attention on the
local quantizations which leave the global gauge group and a subgroup of local
gauge transformations unbroken, as the Feynman quantization of quantum
Electrodynamics, and show that in the non-abelian case such properties cannot
be realized together with Lorentz covariance; thus, quite generally, one cannot
have the structural properties of the Feynman quantization of Quantum
Electrodynamics. By relaxing the condition of Lorentz covariance, we obtain a
classification of Gauss operators, which satisfy gauge covariant conservation
laws and generate non-trivial residual subgroups of local gauge
transformations.

                                        <span>  Moduli stabilisation is key to obtaining phenomenologically viable string
models. Non-geometric compactifications, like T-duality orbifolds (T-folds),
are capable of freezing many moduli. However, in this Letter we emphasise that
T-folds, admitting free fermionic descriptions, can be associated with a large
number of different T-folds with varying number of moduli, since the fermion
pairings for bosonisation are far from unique. Consequently, in one description
a fermionic construction might appear to be asymmetric, and hence
non-geometric, while in another it admits a symmetric orbifold description. We
introduce the notion of intrinsically asymmetric T-folds for fermionic
constructions that do not admit any symmetric orbifold description after
bosonisation. Finally, we argue that fermion symmetries induce mappings in the
bosonised description that extend the T-duality group.

                                        <span>  The IKKT model is a promising candidate for a non-perturbative description of
Type IIB superstring theory. It is known from analytic approaches and numerical
simulations that the IKKT matrix model with a mass term admits interesting
cosmological solutions. However, this mass term is often introduced by hand,
and serves as a regulator in the theory. In the present paper, we show that an
effective mass matrix can arise naturally in the IKKT model by imposing a
toroidal compactification where the space-time fermions acquire anti-periodic
boundary conditions. When six spatial dimensions are chosen to be compact, the
effective mass matrix breaks the SO(1,9) space-time symmetry of the IKKT model
to SO(1,3) $\times$ SO(6). This paves the way for space-time solutions of the
IKKT model where SO(1,9) symmetry is naturally broken to SO(1,3) $\times$
SO(6).

                                        <span>  We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a
$(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical
vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the
existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the
time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory
contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem
provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit,
where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of
quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral
limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total
flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states
into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We
demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely
flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component
into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization
of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the
lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the
magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to
prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic
field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The
topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic
practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems
including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.

scalarized black holes, as well as investigate how a Ricci coupling influences
them. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the Kerr metric in terms
of the location and geodesic frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit
and light ring, with the former exhibiting more pronounced disparities. The
shadows of scalarized black holes exhibit relatively minor deviations when
compared to those of Kerr black holes with the same mass and spin. Overall, the
presence of a Ricci coupling is observed to mitigate deviations from the Kerr
metric.

                                        <span>  The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation
of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are
now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions,
incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense
discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of
total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations
of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions
cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the
treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral
formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of
interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a
new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids
the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of
the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating
by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We
explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space
variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations, and
we provide diagrammatic rules to systematically classify all possible
contributions. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of
Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic
terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for
performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation [...]. Being
already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of
primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear
dynamics of quantum states during inflation.

proving the uniqueness of connected $(3+1)$-dimensional static vacuum
asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes. In consequence, we prove geometric
inequalities for connected $(n+1)$-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically
flat black holes, recovering results by Agostiniani and Mazzieri. We also
obtain similar geometric inequalities for connected $(n+1)$-dimensional static
vacuum asymptotically flat equipotential photon surfaces and in particular
photon spheres. Assuming a natural upper bound on the total scalar curvature,
we recover the well-known uniqueness results for such black holes and
equipotential photon surfaces. We also extend the known equipotential photon
surface uniqueness results to spacetimes with negative mass. In order to
replace the role of the Cotton tensor in Robinson's proof, we introduce
techniques inspired by the analysis of Ricci solitons.

Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement
of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and
Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational
influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper
revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system,
including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus
made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass
flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We
then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from
GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a
first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an
exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to
obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps
within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition,
our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM
clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force
beyond gravity.

                                        <span>  It has been recently proposed that Hawking evaporation might slow down after
a black hole has lost about half of its mass. Such an effect, called "memory
burden", is parameterized as a suppression in the mass loss rate by negative
powers $n$ of the black hole entropy and could considerably extend the lifetime
of a black hole. We study the impact of memory burden on the Primordial Black
Hole (PBH) reheating scenario. Modified PBH evaporation leads to a
significantly longer PBH dominated stage. Requiring that PBHs evaporate prior
enough to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis shrinks the allowed PBH mass range. Indeed,
we find that for $n>2.5$ the PBH reheating scenario is not viable. The
frequency of the Gravitational Waves (GWs) induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is bound to be larger than about a Hz, while the amplitude of the
GW spectrum is enhanced due to the longer PBH dominated phase. Interestingly,
we show that, in some models, the slope of the induced GW spectrum might be
sensitive to the modifications to Hawking evaporation, proving it may be
possible to test the "memory burden" effect via induced GWs. Lastly, we argue
that our results could also apply to general modifications of Hawking
evaporation.

energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This
work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction
between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function
of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an
approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that
governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector
along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm
to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis
of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating
diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for
the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which
encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero
$\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit)
corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the
addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of
$\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This
study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear
cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of
constraints on the dark sector interaction.

                                        <span>  We study the evolution of the dark energy equation of the state parameter
without tying ourselves to any specific cosmological model or parametrization
except spatial homogeneity, isotropy, and flatness leading to a flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Instead, we rely on actual
observational data to guide our analysis. This is the first study in which we
combine the cosmological background and the growth observations to reconstruct
the equation of the state parameter of dark energy independent of the present
values of the matter-energy density parameter and Hubble parameter. We use
information about the Hubble parameter from cosmic chronometer data and the
growth rate from observations related to growth rates. Our method involves a
posterior approach of Gaussian process regression analysis to figure out the
Hubble parameter and growth rate, plus their changes with redshift. The
significant shift of paradigm in this study lies in the independence of the
reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state from any prior knowledge of
the present Hubble parameter and matter energy density parameter. We find a
slight hint of dynamical behavior in dark energy. However, the evidence is not
significant. We also find a leaning towards non-phantom behavior over phantom
behavior. Intriguingly, we observe that the $\Lambda$CDM model nearly touches
the lower boundary of the 1$\sigma$ confidence region for the reconstructed
dark energy equation of state parameter in the redshift range $0.6 \lesssim z
\lesssim 0.85$. However, it comfortably resides within the 1$\sigma$ confidence
region in the redshift range under investigation, $0\leq z \leq 1.5$.
Consequently, the non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of dark
energy provides no compelling evidence to deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model
when considering cosmic chronometer and growth rate observations.

approach and perspective for classifying black hole systems. In this work, we
explore the thermodynamical topology of the quantum BTZ black hole by employing
the concept of the generalized free energy. To fully characterize the
thermodynamics, we introduce two distinct topological numbers. The first one is
determined by an expression, denoted by $z$, derived from the free energy.
Although it can provide us with some local physical explanations, sufficient
physical significance still lacks from a global perspective. On the other hand,
the second topological number is based on the entropy expression of the
generalized free energy, leading to a more meaningful interpretation of its
physical implications. This result highlights the natural choice of entropy as
the domain variable for the generalized free energy. Regarding the second
topological number, our analysis reveals a topological transition that is
associated with the thermodynamical stability of the ``cold" black hole state
of the quantum BTZ black hole. Furthermore, our study suggests the existence of
topological numbers beyond the conventional values of $\pm 1,0$.

particle will deviate from the geodesic. Using the effective potential method,
we study the motion of a spinning test particle on the equatorial plane of a
polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity described by the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with minimal spin-gravity interaction. We
find that for the bounded orbits in the radial direction, the particle's motion
is timelike when its spin is small. The radial range of the orbit and its
eccentricity decrease with the loop quantum gravity parameter. However, when
the particle takes a large enough spin, we observe an interesting phenomenon
that the timelike and spacelike motions alternately appear while are separated
by a critical radius. Outside the critical radius, the motion is timelike,
however inside it is spacelike, and on the radius $r_c$ it is null. To explore
more observable effects of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of
the spinning particle, we focus our attention on the circular orbits,
particularly the innermost stable circular orbits, near the black hole. The
result shows that for the same spin, there are two different innermost stable
circular orbits, one with a larger radius and the other with a smaller radius.
Both the radii decrease as the loop quantum gravity parameter increases. More
significantly, with the increase of the spin of the particle, the small
innermost stable circular orbit transition from timelike to spacelike, while
the one with large radius does not. Instead, it terminates at a certain value
of spin. All the results present the significant influences of the loop quantum
gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particles.

spacetime connectivity between the holographic screens located on the
(stretched) horizons emerges from holographic entanglement. To do so, we
construct a covariant holographic entanglement entropy prescription in de
Sitter space, including quantum corrections. While this prescription is
inspired by the bilayer proposal, we argue that the monolayer proposal appears
to be inconsistent. Entanglement wedge reconstruction implies an extension of
static patch holography where the exterior region connecting the static patches
is included, and reconstructible from the two screens. A phase transition
occurs where there is an exchange of dominance between two competing quantum
extremal surfaces, leading to a transfer of the encoding of the exterior region
from one screen to the other. The effects in the bulk of integrating out
degrees of freedom from the screens are discussed.

classification of elementary particles based on the coadjoint orbit method. We
study the momentum map of the corresponding symmetry group $G_1$ which
conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the electric charge is not
frame-invariant, in contradiction with the experimental observations. In other
words, it is not the symmetry group of the Universe today as we know it. To
avert this paradox, we scale the fifth coordinate and consider the limit when
the cylinder radius vanishes. For the corresponding group $G_0$, the charge is
invariant. On this ground, we propose a cosmological scenario in which the
elementary particles of the early Universe are classified from the momenta of
the group $G_1$, next the three former dimensions inflate quickly while the
fifth one shrinks, leading to the 4D era in which as today the particles are
characterized by the momenta of the group $G_0$. By this mechanism, the
elementary particles can acquire electric charge as a by-product of the 4 + 1
symmetry breaking of the Universe. This work opens the way to the geometric
quantization of charged elementary particles. We construct the corresponding
$G_0$-connections by pullback on the space-time. Imposing that the linear
5-momentum is parallel-transported, we recover the conservation of the charge
and the equation of motion with Lorentz force. We revisit the variational
relativity and obtain the field equations for both the gravitation and
electromagnetic interactions with coupling terms which are negligible at the
Newtonian approximation, allowing to recover Maxwell equations.

even considering a stationary spacetime. The problem becomes even more
difficult if the electromagnetic signal propagates through a flowing optical
medium. Indeed, because of the interaction between light and matter, the signal
does not follow a null geodesic path of the spacetime metric anymore. However,
having a clear description of how the time and frequency transfers are affected
in this very situation is of a prime importance in astronomy. As a matter of
fact, ranging to satellites and Moon, very long baseline interferometry, global
navigation satellite systems, and radio occultation experiments are few
examples of techniques involving light propagation in flowing optical media. By
applying the time transfer functions formalism to optical spacetime, we show
that the time and frequency transfers can be determined iteratively up to any
desired order within the quasi-Minkowskian path approximation. We present some
applications in the context of radio occultation experiments and discuss
possible future applications to the modeling of tropospheric delays.

                                        <span>  The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact
binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day
instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This
astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the
gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The
traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates
its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A
different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all
individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population
properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total
merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the
coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them,
though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually
interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the
implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe
each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the
compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the
event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a
uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the
traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from
binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio <8), and the
template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average
signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information
accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any
claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which
binaries contribute to said detection.

of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both
classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of
open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can
lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that
allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the
appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the
non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in
the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our
proposed criterion.

                                        <span>  In this study, we employ the thermodynamic topological method to classify
critical points for the dyonic AdS black holes with QTE in the EGB background.
To this end, we find that there is a small/large BH phase transition in any
space-time dimension, a conventional critical point exists with the total
topological charge of $Q_t=-1$. The existence of the coupling constant $\alpha$
gives rise to a more intricate phase structure of the black hole, with the
emergence of a triple points requires $\alpha\geq0.5$ and $d=6$. Interestingly,
the condition for the simultaneous occurrence of small/intermediate and
intermediate/large phase transition is that the coupling constant a takes a
special value ($\alpha=0.5$), the two conventional critical points
$(CP_{1},CP_{2})$ of the black hole are (physical) critical point, and the
novel critical point that lacks the capability to minimize the Gibbs free
energy. The critical point ($Q_{CP_1}=Q_{CP_2}=-1$) is observed to occur at the
maximum extreme points of temperature in the isobaric curve, while the critical
point $(Q_{CP_3}=1)$, emerges at the minimum extreme points of temperature.
Furthermore, the number of phases at the novel critical point exhibits an
upward trend, followed by a subsequent decline at the conventional critical
points. With the increase of the coupling constant $(\alpha = 1 )$, although
the system has three critical points, only $CP_{1}$ is a (physical) critical
point, and the $CP_{2}$ serves as the phase annihilation point. This means that
the coupling constant $\alpha$ has a non-negligible effect on the phase
structure of the black hole.

                                        <span>  Holography relates gravitational theories in five dimensions to
four-dimensional quantum field theories in flat space. Under this map, the
equation of state of the field theory is encoded in the black hole solutions of
the gravitational theory. Solving the five-dimensional Einstein's equations to
determine the equation of state is an algorithmic, direct problem. Determining
the gravitational theory that gives rise to a prescribed equation of state is a
much more challenging, inverse problem. We present a novel approach to solve
this problem based on physics-informed neural networks. The resulting algorithm
is not only data-driven but also informed by the physics of the Einstein's
equations. We successfully apply it to theories with crossovers, first- and
second-order phase transitions.

                                        <span>  How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based
on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of
double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter
(LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in
arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete
complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions.
First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the
doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord
states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of
a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary
time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection
between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which
describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of
the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic
systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the
number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of
boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We
interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in
a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines
between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate
a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on
its possible dual manifestations.

                                        <span>  The prospect of unprecedented high-quality data of gravitational waves in the
upcoming decades demands a theoretical effort to optimally study and analyze
the signals that next generation detectors will provide. Here we study the
gravitational wave emission and related dynamics during the inspiralling phase
of the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem, a modification of the
conventional binary scenario in which a small third object co-rotates with the
parent binary system. Specifically, we obtain analytic expressions for the
emitted power, frequency variation and other dynamical variables that describe
the evolution of the system. As a key highlight, we find that the presence of
the third body actually slows down the coalescence of the binary, which can be
partially interpreted as an effective rescaling of the binary's chirp-mass. Our
analysis assumes semi-Keplerian orbits for the particles and a highly mass
asymmetric parent binary needed for the stability of orbits.

                                        <span>  This paper focuses on the Starobinsky model of inflation. We derive solutions
for various cosmological observables, such as the scalar spectral index $n_s$,
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and their runnings, as well as the number of
$e$-folds of inflation, reheating, and radiation with minimal assumptions. We
establish an equation that connects inflation and reheating, which can be
solved for the spectral index $n_s$. Using consistency relations of the model,
we determine the other observables, the number of $e$-folds during inflation
$N_k$, and the number of $e$-folds during reheating $N_{re}$. The impact of
reheating on inflation is explored by constraining the equation of state
parameter $\omega_{re}$ at the end of reheating. We find remarkable agreement
between the Starobinsky model and current measurements of the power spectrum of
primordial curvature perturbations and the present bounds on the spectrum of
primordial gravitational waves.

                                        <span>  The imprint of interacting dark energy (IDE) needs to be correctly identified
in order to avoid bias in constraints on IDE. This paper investigates the
large-scale imprint of IDE in redshift space distortions, using $Euclid$-like
photometric prescriptions. A first attempt at incorporating the IDE dynamics in
the galaxy (clustering and evolution) biases is made. Without IDE dynamics
taken into account in the galaxy biases, as is conventionally done, the results
suggest that for a constant dark energy equation of state parameter, an IDE
model where the dark energy transfer rate is proportional to the dark energy
density exhibits an alternating, positive-negative effect in the redshift space
distortions angular power spectrum. However, when the IDE dynamics is
incorporated in the galaxy biases, it is found that the apparent
positive-negative alternating effect vanishes: implying that neglecting IDE
dynamics in the galaxy biases can result in ''artefacts'' that can lead to
incorrect identification of the IDE imprint. In general, the results show that
multi-tracer analysis will be needed to beat down cosmic variance in order for
the redshift space distortions angular power spectrum as a statistic to be a
viable diagnostic of IDE. Moreover, it is found that redshift space distortions
hold the potential to constrain IDE on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\,
1$; with the scenario having IDE dynamics incorporated in the biases showing
better potential.

suitable parameterizations of the dark energy and then confronted to
cosmological background data. Here we parameterize a pseudorip scenario using a

its evolutionary features and statistical performance. This depiction of a non

                                        <span>  We present a simple model which generates cosmological anisotropies on top of
standard FLRW geometry. This is in some sense reminiscent of the mean field
approximation, where the mean field cosmological model under consideration
would be the standard FLRW, and the anisotropy is a small perturbative
correction on top of it. Using a supergravity-inspired model, we confirm that
the stable fixed point of our model corresponds to standard FLRW cosmology. We
use a Bianchi VII$_0$-type model supplemented with a scalar and $U(1)$ gauge
fields, and we show that the anisotropies of the geometry are generated by the
non-trivial interaction between the gravity sector and the $U(1)$ gauge sector.
Studying the attractor flow, we show that the anisotropies are present at early
times (high redshift) and decay asymptotically to an FLRW attractor fixed
point. With such a mechanism, observations of non-isotropy are not
contradictory to FLRW geometry or indeed the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such models
could in principle shed some insights on the present cosmological tensions.

constant $H_0$ is an integration constant. Thus, consistency of the model
demands observational constancy of $H_0$. We demonstrate redshift evolution of
best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ in Pantheon+ supernove
(SNe). Redshift evolution of best fit cosmological parameters is a prerequisite
to finding a statistically significant evolution as well as identifying
alternative models that are competitive with $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model
comparison. To assess statistical significance, we employ three different
methods: i) Bayesian model comparison, ii) mock simulations and iii) profile
distributions. The first shows a marginal preference for the vanilla
$\Lambda$CDM model over an ad hoc model with 3 additional parameters and an
unphysical jump in cosmological parameters at $z=1$. From mock simulations, we
estimate the statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit
parameters and negative dark energy density ($\Omega_m > 1$) to be in the $1-2
\sigma$ range, depending on the criteria employed. Importantly, in direct
comparison to the same analysis with the earlier Pantheon sample we find that
statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters has
increased, as expected for a physical effect. Our profile distribution analysis
demonstrates a shift in $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ in excess of $95\%$ confidence level
for SNe with redshifts $z > 1$ and also shows that a degeneracy in MCMC
posteriors is not equivalent to a curve of constant $\chi^2$. Our findings can
be interpreted as a statistical fluctuation or unexplored systematics in
Pantheon+ or $\Lambda$CDM model breakdown. The first two possibilities are
disfavoured by similar trends in independent probes.

                                        <span>  A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order
to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained
attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity
bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski
gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the
language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into
$\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of
Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant
sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for
the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear
perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$,
associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the
addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient
conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these
functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation
$\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of
gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete
formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the
strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of
scalar-tensor theories.

position of a test particle. The proposed 'velocity kick' memory effect,

that the 'velocity kick' memory is an artefact resulting from an unjustified

the small-scale enhancement of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations.
In this paper, we specifically focus on non-canonical warm inflationary
scenarios and study a model of warm Higgs-G inflation, in which the Standard
Model Higgs boson drives inflation, with a Galileon-like non-linear kinetic
term. We show that in the Galileon-dominated regime, the primordial power
spectrum is strongly enhanced, leading to the formation of primordial black
holes (PBH) with a wide range of the mass spectrum. Interestingly, PBHs in the
asteroid mass window $\sim (10^{17}$ -- $10^{23}$) g are generated in this
model, which can explain the total abundance of the dark matter in the
Universe. In our analysis, we also calculate the secondary gravitational waves
(GW) sourced by these small-scale overdense fluctuations and find that the
induced GW spectrum can be detected in the future GW detectors, such as LISA,
BBO, DECIGO, etc. Our scenario thus provides a novel way of generating PBHs as
dark matter and a detectable stochastic GW background from warm inflation. We
also show that our scenario is consistent with the swampland and the
trans-Planckian censorship conjectures and, thus, remains in the viable
landscape of UV complete theories.

gravitational waves (GW), encoding the effects of interaction and
self-interaction in a time, frequency and polarization dependent effective
speed. In terms of an appropriately defined effective metric, the effective

  This effective approach predicts that for theories with matter coupled to the
Einstein frame metric the ratio between gravitational and electromagnetic (EM)
luminosity distance depends on the effective speed, while for Jordan frame
matter coupling it depends on the effective Planck mass. We discuss how the
frequency and polarization dependence of the GW-EM distance ratio provides a
new test of general relativity and its modifications, and more in general of
the interaction of GWs with other fields.

the quantum nature of the gas particles. Then, we analyze the fundamental

Hamiltonian does not contain a potential, indicating the lack of classical
thermodynamic interaction, we show that the curvature of the equilibrium space

Boltzmann gas, we show that the equilibrium space becomes flat, as expected
from the physical viewpoint. In addition, we derive a thermodynamic fundamental
equation for the Bose-Einstein condensation and, using the Ehrenfest scheme, we
show that it can be considered as a first order phase transition which in the
equilibrium space corresponds to a curvature singularity. This result indicates
that the curvature of the equilibrium space can be used to measure in an
invariant way the thermodynamic interaction in classical and quantum ideal
gases.

                                        <span>  We present a novel background-independent framework for cosmic inflation,
starting with a matrix model. In this framework, inflation is portrayed as a
dynamic process responsible for the generation of both space and time. This
stands in contrast to conventional inflation, which is characterized as a mere
(exponential) expansion of an already existing spacetime, driven by the vacuum
energy associated with an inflaton field. We observe that the cosmic inflation
is triggered by the condensate of Planck energy into vacuum and responsible for
the dynamical emergence of spacetime. The emergent spacetime picture admits a
background-independent formulation so that the inflation is described by a
conformal Hamiltonian system which requires neither an inflaton field nor an ad
hoc inflation potential. This implies that the emergent spacetime may
incapacitate all the rationales to introduce the multiverse hypothesis.

                                        <span>  A quantum cosmological bouncing model may exhibit an ambiguity stemming from
the nonclassical nature of the background evolution: two classically equivalent
theories can produce two qualitatively different potentials sourcing the
perturbations. We derive explicitly the quantum canonical transformation
involving the quantum background to show how it leads to inequivalent theories.
We identify the relevant quantum parameter describing the difference and expand
upon the ambiguity by calculating the expected power spectra produced for
initial quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase of both
potentials. We find that one spectral index corresponds to all values of this
parameter but one, while the other thus represents a set of measure zero.

                                        <span>  We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of
the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping
for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the
Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate
applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit
operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected
advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its
rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time
evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for
qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable
improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.

show that they are broken at the leading order in bosonic correlation

gauge groups. We solve a set of coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations in Landau
gauge for a variable, fractional number $N_f$ of massless fermions in the
fundamental representation. For large $N_f$ we find a phase transition from a
chirally broken into a chirally symmetric phase that is consistent with the
behavior expected inside the conformal window. Even in the presence of fermions
the gauge-boson--ghost-vertex dressing remains small. In the conformal window
this vertex shows the expected power law behavior. It does not assume its
tree-level value in the far infrared, but the respective dressing function is a
constant greater than one.

                                        <span>  The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental
constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle
physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard
Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark
Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In
fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs
boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called
``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years.
We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and
indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the
nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale
(i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly
accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After
discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we
summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions.
In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates.
Discovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.

                                        <span>  Formulating non-Abelian gauge theories as a tensor network is known to be
challenging due to the internal degrees of freedom that result in the
degeneracy in the singular value spectrum. In two dimensions, it is
straightforward to 'trace out' these degrees of freedom with the use of
character expansion, giving a reduced tensor network where the degeneracy
associated with the internal symmetry is eliminated. In this work, we show that
such an index loop also exists in higher dimensions in the form of a closed
tensor network we call the 'armillary sphere'. This allows us to completely
eliminate the matrix indices and reduce the overall size of the tensors in the
same way as is possible in two dimensions. This formulation allows us to
include significantly more representations with the same tensor size, thus
making it possible to reach a greater level of numerical accuracy in the tensor
renormalization group computations.

                                        <span>  We present a lattice QCD calculation of the transversity isovector- and
isoscalar-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton utilizing a
perturbative matching at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy. Additionally, we
determine the isovector and isoscalar tensor charges for the proton. In both
calculations, the disconnected contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements
have been ignored. The calculations are performed using a single ensemble of
$N_f = 2 +1$ highly-improved staggered quarks simulated with physical-mass
quarks and a lattice spacing of $a = 0.076$ fm. The Wilson-clover action, with
physical quark masses and smeared gauge links obtained from one iteration of
hypercubic smearing, is used in the valence sector. Using the NLO operator
product expansion, we extract the lowest four to six Mellin moments and the
PDFs via a neural network from the matrix elements in the pseudo-PDF approach.
In addition, we calculate the PDFs in the quasi-PDF approach with hybrid-scheme
renormalization and the recently developed leading-renormalon resummation
technique, at NLO with the resummation of leading small-$x$ logarithms.

                                        <span>  Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in
closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a realistic scheme to
comprehensively explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We
show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to
a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.
The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the
transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property
facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the
integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to
the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal
interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity
of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role
of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body
localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest
themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art
Rydberg array setups.

single-mode cavity driven by a two-photon drive. Our results show that, when
the two qubits are strongly coupled to the cavity field, the collective
radiation emitted from the qubits exhibits hyperradiance which can be detected
as a signature of two qubit entanglement in the weak-driving regime. We
quantify the entanglement in terms of concurrence. Additionally, we study the
radiance behaviour in the presence of an intracavity Kerr-nonlinear medium that
leads to two-photon blockade. Our results suggest that this system with
nonlinearity may act as a quadrature-squezzed and hyperradiant two-photon
source.

photo-ionization of the excited ortho- and para-Helium states. A simple
estimation, based on the ionization probability amplitudes, shows that the
different form of anti-symmetrising both states can in principle lead to very
different values of the correlation time delay. This result illuminates the
interplay between electronic correlations and symmetrisation effects in the
attosecond regime, a relation that has been studied in other contexts.
Moreover, it suggests the potential of excited states to explore the role of
exchange effects in that realm.

                                        <span>  The proton, deuteron and triton masses can be determined relative to the
electron mass via rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions. This
has to occur via comparison of the experimentally measured transition
frequencies and the ab initio calculated frequencies, whose dependence on the
mass ratios can be calculated precisely. In precision experiments to date (on
HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level
$v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For
these transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the
high-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This
prevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from
experimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially
limited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of
mass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies
between levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio
is positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED
contributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently
determined from a joint analysis of several measurements. We also consider
scenarios where transitions of D$_2^+$ are included. We find these to be
powerful approaches, allowing in principle to reach uncertainties for the mass
ratios two orders smaller than CODATA 2018, and without using muonic hydrogen
data. For the Rydberg constant and the charge radii, improvements by factors of
4 to 11 are projected.

                                        <span>  We theoretically describe the phenomenon of non-adiabatic spin dynamics,
which occurs in a gas cell filled by alkali vapor in presence of a strong
alternating magnetic field and pump light. Steep increase of the spin
polarization occurs if frequency of the magnetic field is equal to the certain
value. Although, the observable effect relies on the periodic field that
consists of two perpendicular components defined by harmonics with the same
amplitudes and different frequencies. Considered spin effect cannot be
explained by a resonance, because the own Larmor frequency of spin precession
is absent without a constant component of magnetic field. Moreover, there are
some clearly visible peaks in the excitation spectrum of spin polarization, and
they are super narrow in comparison to relaxation rate. Detailed analysis
according to proposed quantum model results in the reasoning of the effect via
qualitative properties of non-adiabatic dynamics of atomic spin.

                                        <span>  Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in
closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a realistic scheme to
comprehensively explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We
show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to
a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.
The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the
transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property
facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the
integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to
the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal
interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity
of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role
of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body
localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest
themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art
Rydberg array setups.

                                        <span>  The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum
systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum
technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in
order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative
master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the
system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield
sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In
particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very
accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak
and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master
equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of
heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration.
This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of
perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master
equations does not involve additional complications when compared with
alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure
thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.

                                        <span>  Superresolution has been demonstrated to overcome the limitation of the
Rayleigh's criterion and achieve significant improvement of the precision in
resolving the centroid separation of two incoherent optical point sources.
However, in recent years, it was found that if the photon numbers of the two
incoherent optical sources are unknown, the precision of superresolution
vanishes when the two photon numbers are actually different. In this work, we
analyze the estimation precision of the centroid separation between two
incoherent optical sources with the same point-spread functions and unknown
photon numbers in detail, and show that when the photon numbers of the two
optical sources are different but sufficiently close, the superresolution can
still realized but with different precisions. We find the condition on how
close the photons numbers of two optical sources need to be to realize the
superresolution, and derive the precision of superresolution in different
regimes of the photon number difference. We further consider the
superresolution for two incoherent optical sources with different point-spread
functions, and show that the competition between the difference of photon
numbers, the difference of the two point-spread functions and the centroid
separation of the two optical sources determines the precision of
superresolution. The results exhibit various precision limits of the centroid
separation distinct from that of two point sources with identical point-spread
functions and equal photon numbers. The results are finally illustrated by
Gaussian point-spread functions.

quantum computers by encoding logical information into multiple physical
qubits. However, no single error-correcting code allows for an intrinsically
fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum
computing [1-3]. One way to tackle this problem is to switch between two
suitable error-correcting codes, while preserving the encoded logical
information, which in combination give access to a fault-tolerant universal
gate set [4-6]. In this work, we present the first experimental implementation
of fault-tolerant code switching between two codes. One is the seven-qubit
color code [7], which features fault-tolerant CNOT and $H$ quantum gates, while
the other one, the 10-qubit code [8], allows for a fault-tolerant $T$-gate
implementation. Together they form a complementary universal gate set. Building
on essential code switching building blocks, we construct logical circuits and
prepare 12 different logical states which are not accessible natively in a
fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to
entangle two logical qubits employing the full universal gate set in a single
logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally open up a new route towards
deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead,
not relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states.

studying condensed matter systems: they are quantitative, noninvasive,
physically robust, offer nanoscale resolution, and may be used across a wide
range of temperatures. These properties have been exploited in recent years to
obtain nanoscale resolution measurements of static magnetic fields arising from
spin order and current flow in condensed matter systems. Compared with other
nanoscale magnetic-field sensors, NV centres have the unique advantage that
they can probe quantities that go beyond average magnetic fields. Leveraging
techniques from magnetic resonance, NV centres can perform high precision noise
sensing, and have given access to diverse systems, such as fluctuating
electrical currents in simple metals and graphene, as well as magnetic dynamics
in yttrium iron garnet. In this review we summarise unique opportunities in
condensed matter sensing by focusing on the connections between specific NV
measurements and previously established physical characteristics that are more
readily understood in the condensed matter community, such as correlation
functions and order parameters that are inaccessible by other techniques, and
we describe the technical frontier enabled by NV centre sensing.

                                        <span>  In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction
ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I
had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superposition by
energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D.
Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as
solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick,
arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation
relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show
that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)]
restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize
the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if
they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An
experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278
(2017)] is described at the end.

                                        <span>  Our study reveals electron spin in a cavity as a stable circulating current
density, characterized by a torus topology. This current density circulates
concentrically beyond the cavity boundary, illustrating the concept of
evanescent wave spin. While the interaction with a uniform magnetic field
aligns with established spin-field observations, our analysis of regional
contributions deviates from particle-based spin predictions. The integration of
charge and spin properties into a single Lorentz covariant entity suggests that
the electron wave constitutes the fundamental and deterministic reality of the
electron.

[4,5,6] that results in the construction of more optimal quantum circuits than
the quantum Shannon decomposition (QSD) [17] can achieve, which has been the
most optimal decomposition method since 2006. With the proposed decomposition,
a general 3-qubit gate can be decomposed using 19 CNOT gates (rather than 20).
For general n-qubit gates, the proposed decomposition generates circuits that
have $(22/48) 4^n - (3/2) 2^n + (5/3)$ CNOT gates , which is less that the best
known exact decomposition algorithm by $(4^{n-2} -1)/3$ CNOT gates.

                                        <span>  The evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on innovative methods
to enhance its security and efficiency. Unextendible Product Bases (UPBs) hold
promise in quantum cryptography due to their inherent indistinguishability, yet
they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This paper introduces a protocol
utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically,
we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice
sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The
protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the
cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including
intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are
noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our
protocol for eavesdroppers, thereby enhancing QKD security.

exceptional role in the space of all $n$-qubit/qudit states. We establish
uncertainty principles for the characteristic function and the Wigner function
of states, respectively. We find that only stabilizer states achieve saturation
in these principles. Furthermore, we prove a general theorem that stabilizer
states are extremal for convex information measures invariant under local
unitaries. We explore this extremality in the context of various quantum
information and correlation measures, including entanglement entropy,
conditional entropy and other entanglement measures. Additionally, leveraging
the recent discovery that stabilizer states are the limit states under quantum
convolution, we establish the monotonicity of the entanglement entropy and
conditional entropy under quantum convolution. These results highlight the
remarkable information-theoretic properties of stabilizer states. Their
extremality provides valuable insights into their ability to capture
information content and correlations, paving the way for further exploration of
their potential in quantum information processing.

                                        <span>  Distributing quantum entanglement between distant parties is a significant
but difficult task in quantum information science, as it can enable numerous
applications but suffers from exponential decay in the quantum channel. Quantum
repeater is one of the most promising approaches towards this goal. In a
quantum repeater protocol, it is essential that the entanglement generation
speed within each elementary link is faster than the memory decoherence rate,
to enable the scale-up of the quantum repeater by connecting neighboring
repeater segments. This stringent requirement has not been implemented over a
fiber of metropolitan scale so far. As a step towards this challenging goal, in
this work we experimentally realize multiplexing-enhanced generation of
heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over a 12km fiber. We excite the
memory modes in a multiplexed quantum memory successively to generate 280 pairs
of atom-photon quantum correlations with a train of photonic time-bin pulses
filling the long fiber. After successful detection of a heralding signal, the
excited memory mode can be identified and retrieved into idler photons on
demand with either fixed or variable storage time. With the multiplexing
enhancement, the heralding rate of atom-photon correlation can reach 1.95kHz,
and the ratio between the quantum correlation generation rate to memory
decoherence rate can be improved to 0.46 for a fiber length of 12km, which is
so far the best for long fiber length (>10km) to our knowledge. This work
therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of a
large-scale quantum repeater network.

rotating wave approximation. We obtain a characterization of the spatial decay
of the energy density. We compute the asymptotic limit of large distances from
the atom at each given time, and find an algebraic behavior of $1/r^6$. This
result confirms that the energy density of single-photon states is nonlocal and
the algebraic decay is far from the maximal quasiexponential localization
predicted by the theory.

non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established
for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general
systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin
effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear
operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems.
A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution
operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian
systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin
effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also
discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an
experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.

information theory. In particular, Mosonyi and Ogawa established a one-shot
strong converse bound for quantum hypothesis testing [Comm. Math. Phys, 334(3),
2014], which servers as a primitive tool for establishing a variety of tight
strong converse theorems in quantum information theory. In this short note, we
demonstrate an alternative one-line proof for this bound via the variational
expression of measured R\'enyi divergences [Lett. Math. Phys, 107(12), 2017].
Then, we show that the variational expression is a direct consequence of
H\"older's inequality.

mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum
information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is
the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum
walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to
find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of
the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in
long time.

faithfully the non self-adjoint nature of momentum for a particle in a box. Its
eigenfunctions are strictly limited to the interior of the box in the continuum
limit, with the quarter wave as first non-trivial eigenstate. We show how to
construct the corresponding hermitean Hamiltonian for the infinite well as
concrete example to realize unitary dynamics. The resulting Hilbert space can
be decomposed into a physical and unphysical subspace, which are mutually
orthogonal. The physical subspace in the continuum limit reproduces that of the
continuum theory and we give numerical evidence that the correct probability
distributions for momentum and energy are recovered.

                                        <span>  Error mitigation has elevated quantum computing to the scale of hundreds of
qubits and tens of layers; however, yet larger scales (deeper circuits) are
needed to fully exploit the potential of quantum computing to solve practical
problems otherwise intractable. Here we demonstrate three key results that pave
the way for the leap from quantum utility to quantum advantage: (1) we present
a thorough derivation of random and systematic errors associated to the most
advanced error mitigation strategies, including probabilistic error
cancellation (PEC), zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) with probabilistic error
amplification, and tensor-network error mitigation (TEM); (2) we prove that TEM
(i) has the lowest sampling overhead among all three techniques under realistic
noise, (ii) is optimal, in the sense that it saturates the universal lower cost
bound for error mitigation, and (iii) is therefore the most promising approach
to quantum advantage; (3) we propose a concrete notion of practical quantum
advantage in terms of the universality of algorithms, stemming from the
commercial need for a problem-independent quantum simulation device. We also
establish a connection between error mitigation, relying on additional
measurements, and error correction, relying on additional qubits, by
demonstrating that TEM with a sufficient bond dimension works similarly to an
error correcting code of distance 3. We foresee that the interplay and
trade-off between the two resources will be the key to a smooth transition
between error mitigation and error correction, and hence between near-term and
fault-tolerant quantum computers. Meanwhile, we argue that quantum computing
with optimal error mitigation, relying on modest classical computer power for
tensor network contraction, has the potential to reach larger scales in
accurate simulation than classical methods alone.

photo-ionization of the excited ortho- and para-Helium states. A simple
estimation, based on the ionization probability amplitudes, shows that the
different form of anti-symmetrising both states can in principle lead to very
different values of the correlation time delay. This result illuminates the
interplay between electronic correlations and symmetrisation effects in the
attosecond regime, a relation that has been studied in other contexts.
Moreover, it suggests the potential of excited states to explore the role of
exchange effects in that realm.

                                        <span>  We demonstrate a novel transmitter concept for quantum key distribution based
on the polarization-encoded BB84 protocol, which is sourced by the incoherent
light of a forward-biased Ge-on-Si PIN junction. We investigate two
architectures for quantum state preparation, including independent polarization
encoding through multiple modulators and a simplified approach leveraging on an
interferometric polarization modulator. We experimentally prove that the
Ge-on-Si light source can accommodate for quantum key generation by
accomplishing raw-key rates of 2.15 kbit/s at a quantum bit error ratio of
7.71% at a symbol rate of 1 GHz. We further investigate the impact of
depolarization along fiber-based transmission channels in combination with the
broadband nature of the incoherent light source. Our results prove the
feasibility of a fully-integrated silicon quantum key distribution transmitter,
including its light source, for possible short-reach applications in zero-trust
intra-datacenter environments.

                                        <span>  As quantum key distribution has reached the maturity level for practical
deployment, questions about the co-integration with existing classical
communication systems are of utmost importance. To this end we demonstrate how
the co-propagation of classical and quantum signals can benefit from the
development of novel hollow-core fibers. We demonstrate a secure key rate of
330 bit/s for a quantum channel at 1538 nm in the presence of 25 x 10 Gb/s
classical channels, transmitted at an aggregated launch power of 12 dBm,
spanning over the C+L-band in the same hollow-core fiber link. Furthermore, we
show the co-integration of the classical key-distillation channel onto this
fiber link, turning it into a bidirectional fiber link and thereby mitigating
the need for multiple fibers. We believe this to be an important step towards
the deployment and integration of hollow-core fibers together with DV-QKD for
the inherently secure telecom network of the future.

                                        <span>  Running quantum algorithms often involves implementing complex quantum
circuits with such a large number of multi-qubit gates that the challenge of
tackling practical applications appears daunting. To date, no experiments have
successfully demonstrated a quantum advantage due to the ease with which the
results can be adequately replicated on classical computers through the use of
tensor network algorithms. Additionally, it remains unclear even in theory
where exactly these advantages are rooted within quantum systems because the
logarithmic complexity commonly associated with quantum algorithms is also
present in algorithms based on tensor networks. In this article, we propose a
novel approach called Tensor Quantum Programming, which leverages tensor
networks for hybrid quantum computing. Our key insight is that the primary
challenge of algorithms based on tensor networks lies in their high ranks (bond
dimensions). Quantum computing offers a potential solution to this challenge,
as an ideal quantum computer can represent tensors with arbitrarily high ranks
in contrast to classical counterparts, which indicates the way towards quantum
advantage. While tensor-based vector-encoding and state-readout are known
procedures, the matrix-encoding required for performing matrix-vector
multiplications directly on quantum devices remained unsolved. Here, we
developed an algorithm that encodes Matrix Product Operators into quantum
circuits with a depth that depends linearly on the number of qubits. It
demonstrates effectiveness on up to 50 qubits for several matrices frequently
encountered in differential equations, optimization problems, and quantum
chemistry. We view this work as an initial stride towards the creation of
genuinely practical quantum algorithms.

with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep
generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show
how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of
the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates.
We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions

in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies
and reproduces that known perturbatively.

                                        <span>  The ability to control quantum systems is necessary for many applications of
quantum technologies ranging from gate generation in quantum computation to NMR
and laser control of chemical reactions. In many practical situations, the
controlled quantum systems are open, i.e., interacting with the environment.
While often influence of the environment is considered as an obstacle for
controlling the systems, in some cases it can be exploited as a useful
resource. In this note, we briefly review some results on control of open
quantum systems using environment as a resource, including control by
engineered environments and by non-selective measurements, Turing
uncomputability of discrete quantum control, parametrization of Kraus maps by
points of the Stiefel manifolds and corresponding Riemanninan optimization,
control by dissipation and time-dependent decoherence rates, reachable sets,
and incoherent GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) -- inGRAPE -- for
gradient-based optimization.

circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding
to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which
is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a
cylinder geometry to classify stationary states after long-time measurement
dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities
for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases exist
in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both the Higgs and confined
phases are clearly separated from the deconfined phase by topological
entanglement entropy, whereas the phase boundary between the Higgs and confined
phases is obtained by long-range orders on the boundaries supporting the recent
observation that the Higgs and confined phases are both one of

                                        <span>  The stationary states of a particle in a central potential are usually taken
as a product of an angular part Phi and a radial part R. The function R
satisfies the so-called radial equation and is usually solved by demanding R to
be finite at the origin. In this work we examine the reason for this
requirement in the case of a two-dimensional (2D) central force problem. In
contrast to some claims commonly accepted, the reason for discarding solutions
with divergent R(0) is not the need to have a normalizable wave function. In
fact some wave functions can be normalized even if R is singular at the origin.
Instead, here we show that if R is singular, the complete wave function psi =
Phi R fails to satisfy the full Schrodinger equation, but follows a equation
similar to Schrodinger's but with an additional term containing the 2D Dirac
delta function or its derivatives. Thus, psi is not a true eigenfunction of the
Hamiltonian. In contrast, there are no additional terms in the equation for
wave functions psi built from solutions R that remain finite at the origin. A
similar situation also occurs for 3D central potentials as has been shown
recently. A comparison between the 2D and 3D cases is carried out.

                                        <span>  Imaging with undetected photons relies upon nonlinear interferometry to
extract the spatial image from an infrared probe beam and reveal it in the
interference pattern of an easier-to-detect visible beam. Typically, the
transmission and phase images are extracted using phase-shifting techniques and
combining interferograms from multiple frames. Here we show that off-axis
digital holography enables reconstruction of both transmission and phase images
at the infrared wavelength from a single interferogram, and hence a single
frame, recorded in the visible. This eliminates the need for phase stepping and
multiple acquisitions, thereby greatly reducing total measurement time for
imaging with long acquisition times at low flux or enabling video-rate imaging
at higher flux. With this single-frame acquisition technique, we are able to
reconstruct transmission images of an object in the infrared beam with a
signal-to-noise ratio of $1.78\,\pm\,0.06$ at 10 frames per second, and record
a dynamic scene in the infrared beam at 33 frames per second.

entangling two distant ferromagnets. To this end we make use of the Bogoliubov
transformation as a symplectic transformation. We show that the coupling of the
uniform magnon modes can be expressed using four squeezing parameters which we
interpret in terms of hybridization, one-mode and two-mode squeezing. We
utilize the expansion in terms of the squeezing parameters to obtain an
analytic formula for the entanglement in the magnon ground state using the
logarithmic negativity as entanglement measure. Our investigation predicts that
for infinitely large two-dimensional ferromagnets, the dipole-dipole
interaction does not lead to significant long-range entanglement. However, in
the case of finite ferromagnets, finite entanglement can be expected

                                        <span>  The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has
recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure
states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on
component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we
systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of
short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both
average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled
Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states
apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries
as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original
density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled
space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of
mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT
invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary
correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for
the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In
addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and
the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an
ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.

                                        <span>  Information-theoretic insights have proven fruitful in many areas of quantum
physics. But can the fundamental dynamics of quantum systems be derived from
purely information-theoretic principles, without resorting to Hilbert space
structures such as unitary evolution and self-adjoint observables? Here we
provide a model where the dynamics originates from a condition of informational
non-equilibrium, the deviation of the system's state from a reference state
associated to a field of identically prepared systems. Combining this idea with
three basic information-theoretic principles, we derive a notion of energy that
captures the main features of energy in quantum theory: it is observable,
bounded from below, invariant under time-evolution, in one-to-one
correspondence with the generator of the dynamics, and quantitatively related
to the speed of state changes. Our results provide an information-theoretic
reconstruction of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum evolutions,
establishing a bridge between dynamical and information-theoretic notions.

                                        <span>  The proton, deuteron and triton masses can be determined relative to the
electron mass via rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions. This
has to occur via comparison of the experimentally measured transition
frequencies and the ab initio calculated frequencies, whose dependence on the
mass ratios can be calculated precisely. In precision experiments to date (on
HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level
$v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For
these transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the
high-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This
prevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from
experimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially
limited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of
mass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies
between levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio
is positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED
contributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently
determined from a joint analysis of several measurements. We also consider
scenarios where transitions of D$_2^+$ are included. We find these to be
powerful approaches, allowing in principle to reach uncertainties for the mass
ratios two orders smaller than CODATA 2018, and without using muonic hydrogen
data. For the Rydberg constant and the charge radii, improvements by factors of
4 to 11 are projected.

channel dissipation. We find that spin squeezing is only possible if the
dissipation is parametrically weaker than the squeezing coupling. Squeezing may
be used for meteorologically useful decrease of spin noise but only in the case
where the squeezing occurs before measurement, in the case one squeezes as one
measures one also squeezes the signal thereby making spin squeezing ineffective
for metrological gain. The key mathematical advance made in this work is the
observation that TACT in the presence of depolarizing noise is equivalent to
TACT with reduced polarization and no noise. We find an exponential gain in
signal to noise with the exponent proportional to the ratio between the
squeezing strength and the depolarization rate.

                                        <span>  A generalized Bose-Hubbard model in a two-mode approximation is applied to
study the rotational dynamics of a direct-current atomtronic quantum
interference device. Modified values of on-site interaction and pair-tunneling
parameters of the Hamiltonian, derived from the small-oscillation periods of
the Josephson modes, are shown to provide an excellent agreement to the
Gross-Pitaevskii simulation results for the whole rotational frequency range,
reaching also the critical values of imbalance and current. This amounts to a
full validation of the semiclassical approximation of the modified Hamiltonian,
whose quantization is employed to investigate the quantum features of the
stationary states. Focusing on the frequency interval where the potential
energy presents two minima, it is shown that the central frequency, at which
such minima are symmetric, yields an atom number parity-protected qubit with a
maximum entanglement of both persistent-current states, similar to those of
superconducting circuits threaded by a half-quantum of applied flux. Such a
parity protection scheme survives within a small interval around the central
frequency, which sets the minimum rotational frequency precision that should be
required to implement the qubit. It is found that such a maximum admissible
error in the frequency determination turns out to be inversely proportional to
the qubit quality factor that measures the gap between the qubit energy levels
and the following levels. It is shown that the chemical potential or condensate
particle number could be employed as suitable control parameters to achieve the
best trade-off between such qubit characteristics.

                                        <span>  Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era,
we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits.
We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively
logarithmic depth, in the task of computing Pauli expectation values. We then
prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren
plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging
the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate
Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high
probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and
it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional
architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken
together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits
to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are
preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli
expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning
proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable
insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling
from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.

simple two-point functions in the probe approximation. We find that de Sitter
equilibrates in a superdiffusive manner, unlike most physical systems which
equilibrate diffusively. We also examine the scrambling time. In de Sitter, the
two-point functions of free fields do not decay for sometime because quanta can
reflect off the pole of the static patch. This suggests a minimum scrambling
time of the order $\log(1/G_N)$, even for perturbations introduced on the
stretched horizon, indicating fast scrambling inside de Sitter static patch. We
also discuss the interplay between thermodynamic temperature and inverse
correlation time, sometimes called "tomperature".

                                        <span>  We apply the hierarchical equations of motion technique to analyzing
nonequilibrium heat transport in a spin-boson type model, whereby heat transfer
through a central spin is mediated by an intermediate pair of coupled harmonic
oscillators. The coupling between each pair of oscillators is shown to
introduce a localized gap into the effective spectral densities characterizing
the system-oscillator-reservoir interactions. Compared to the case of a single
mediating oscillator, we find the heat current to be drastically modified at
weak system-bath coupling. In particular, a second-order treatment fails to
capture the correct steady-state behavior in this regime, which stems from the
$\lambda^4$-scaling of the energy transfer rate to lowest order in the coupling
strength $\lambda$. This leads naturally to a strong suppression in the
steady-state current in the asymptotically weak coupling limit. On the other
hand, the current noise follows the same scaling as in the single oscillator
case in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, we
find the heat current to be consistent with Fourier's law even at large
temperature bias. Our analysis highlights a novel mechanism for controlling
heat transport in nanoscale systems based on tailoring the spectral properties
of thermal environments.

                                        <span>  Hamiltonian simulation is arguably the most fundamental application of
quantum computers. The Magnus operator is a popular method for time-dependent
Hamiltonian simulation in computational mathematics, yet its usage requires the
implementation of exponentials of commutators, which has previously made it
unappealing for quantum computing. The development of commutator-free
quasi-Magnus operators (CFQMs) circumvents this obstacle, at the expense of a
lack of provable global numeric error bounds. In this work, we establish one
such error bound for CFQM-based time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian simulation
by carefully estimating the error of each step involved in their definition.
This allows us to compare its cost with the alternatives, and show that CFQMs
are often the most efficient product-formula technique available by more than
an order of magnitude. As a result, we find that CFQMs may be particularly
useful to simulate time-dependent Hamiltonians on early fault-tolerant quantum
computers.

random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a
holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity.
Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be
feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of
reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified
version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with
probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form
factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair
correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$
(characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We
find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as
$1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full
unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But
for $p<p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a
breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller
value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive
eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral
rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very
highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation
infidelity as a loss function.

                                        <span>  We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D)
topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that
the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological
order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground
state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence,
previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is
more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out"
anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons
generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric
under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking
connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem
codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders.
Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a
classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and
even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered
states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a
partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.

                                        <span>  Gaussian Boson Sampling is a popular method for experimental demonstrations
of quantum advantage, but many subtleties remain in fully understanding its
theoretical underpinnings. An important component in the theoretical arguments
for approximate average-case hardness of sampling is anticoncentration, which
is a second-moment property of the output probabilities. In Gaussian Boson
Sampling these are given by hafnians of generalized circular orthogonal
ensemble matrices. In a companion work [arXiv:2312.08433], we develop a
graph-theoretic method to study these moments and use it to identify a
transition in anticoncentration. In this work, we find a recursive expression
for the second moment using these graph-theoretic techniques. While we have not
been able to solve this recursion by hand, we are able to solve it numerically
exactly, which we do up to Fock sector $2n = 80$. We further derive new
analytical results about the second moment. These results allow us to pinpoint
the transition in anticoncentration and furthermore yield the expected linear
cross-entropy benchmarking score for an ideal (error-free) device.

                                        <span>  We propose a dynamic mechanism for the reversible regulation of
photochemistry in plants under varying light environments. We employ a
three-level quantum model to take into account the correlations between charge
donors and charge acceptors immediately before photoexcitation, and show that
under steady and coherent driving of light, the efficiency of charge transfer
is inversely proportional to the intensity of incident light, which can be
suppressed so severely that it becomes a limiting factor on photosynthetic
electron transport. These results are analyzed to gain insight in the light
responses of photosynthetic parameters. We discuss the implications of thermal
fluctuation in the light source used in photochemical experiments, and argue
that in high light conditions, the quantum yields measured with an incandescent
lamp may be higher than those measured with a laser, a manifestation of thermal
fluctuation in lamp illumination. Our new picture renders a consistent
interpretation of a wide range of experiments, including plastocyanin-dependent
electron transport in photosystem I, biphasic redox kinetics of P700 and
wavelength-dependent quantum yields, and provides a donor-side scheme for the
onset of irreversible damage to photosystem II.

both, the state of other emitters and the state of the surrounding radiation.
Such instances combine two central topics in quantum optics that are typically
treated separately: collective decay and non-Markovian dynamics. Here we access
collective non-Markovian decay through the exact solution for two excited
quantum emitters located at adjacent unit cells of a one-dimensional
single-band waveguide. The transformed field amplitudes, which we express in
terms of elementary functions, combine exponential, algebraic, fractional, and
mixed algebraic-exponential decay, as well as logarithmic corrections to some
of the algebraic parts. We develop analytic methods for multiparticle open
quantum systems that shed light on the complexity of non-linear quantum optical
phenomena.

                                        <span>  In recent years, the physics of many-body quantum chaotic systems close to
their ground states has come under intensified scrutiny. Such studies are
motivated by the emergence of model systems exhibiting chaotic fluctuations
throughout the entire spectrum (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model being a
renowned representative) as well as by the physics of holographic principles,
which likewise unfold close to ground states. Interpreting the edge of the
spectrum as a quantum critical point, here we combine a wide range of
analytical and numerical methods to the identification and comprehensive
description of two different universality classes: the near edge physics of
``sparse'' and the near edge of ``dense'' chaotic systems. The distinction lies
in the ratio between the number of a system's random parameters and its Hilbert
space dimension, which is exponentially small or algebraically small in the
sparse and dense case, respectively. Notable representatives of the two classes
are generic chaotic many-body models (sparse) and single particle systems,
invariant random matrix ensembles, or chaotic gravitational systems (dense).
While the two families share identical spectral correlations at energy scales
comparable to the level spacing, the density of states and its fluctuations
near the edge are different. Considering the SYK model as a representative of
the sparse class, we apply a combination of field theory and exact
diagonalization to a detailed discussion of its edge spectrum. Conversely,
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is our reference model for the dense class, where an
analysis of the gravitational path integral and random matrix theory reveal
universal differences to the sparse class, whose implications for the
construction of holographic principles we discuss.

theoretical physics. In particular, symbolic regression (SR) is making rapid
progress in recent years as a tool to fit data using functions whose overall
form is not known in advance. Assuming that we have a mathematical problem that
is posed analytically, e.g.~through equations, but allows easy numerical
evaluation of the solution for any given set of input variable values, one can
generate data numerically and then use SR to identify the closed-form function
that describes the data, assuming that such a function exists. In addition to
providing a concise way to represent the solution of the problem, such an
obtained function can play a key role in providing insight and allow us to find
an intuitive explanation for the studied phenomenon. We use a state-of-the-art
SR package to demonstrate how an exact solution can be found and make an
attempt at solving an unsolved physics problem. We use the Landau-Zener problem
and a few of its generalizations as examples to motivate our approach and
illustrate how the calculations become increasingly complicated with increasing
problem difficulty. Our results highlight the capabilities and limitations of
the presently available SR packages, and they point to possible modifications
of these packages to make them better suited for the purpose of finding exact
solutions as opposed to good approximations. Our results also demonstrate the
potential for machine learning to tackle analytically posed problems in
theoretical physics.

                                        <span>  Quantum error correction with erasure qubits promises significant advantages
over standard error correction due to favorable thresholds for erasure errors.
To realize this advantage in practice requires a qubit for which nearly all
errors are such erasure errors, and the ability to check for erasure errors
without dephasing the qubit. We demonstrate that a "dual-rail qubit" consisting
of a pair of resonantly coupled transmons can form a highly coherent erasure
qubit, where transmon $T_1$ errors are converted into erasure errors and
residual dephasing is strongly suppressed, leading to millisecond-scale
coherence within the qubit subspace. We show that single-qubit gates are
limited primarily by erasure errors, with erasure probability $p_\text{erasure}
= 2.19(2)\times 10^{-3}$ per gate while the residual errors are $\sim 40$ times
lower. We further demonstrate mid-circuit detection of erasure errors while
introducing $< 0.1\%$ dephasing error per check. Finally, we show that the
suppression of transmon noise allows this dual-rail qubit to preserve high
coherence over a broad tunable operating range, offering an improved capacity
to avoid frequency collisions. This work establishes transmon-based dual-rail
qubits as an attractive building block for hardware-efficient quantum error
correction.

                                        <span>  The problem of optimally measuring an analytic function of unknown local
parameters each linearly coupled to a qubit sensor is well understood, with
applications ranging from field interpolation to noise characterization. Here,
we resolve a number of open questions that arise when extending this framework
to Mach-Zehnder interferometers and quadrature displacement sensing. In
particular, we derive lower bounds on the achievable mean square error in
estimating a linear function of either local phase shifts or quadrature
displacements. In the case of local phase shifts, these results prove, and
somewhat generalize, a conjecture by Proctor et al. [arXiv:1702.04271 (2017)].
For quadrature displacements, we extend proofs of lower bounds to the case of
arbitrary linear functions. We provide optimal protocols achieving these bounds
up to small (multiplicative) constants and describe an algebraic approach to
deriving new optimal protocols, possibly subject to additional constraints.
Using this approach, we prove necessary conditions for the amount of
entanglement needed for any optimal protocol for both local phase and
displacement sensing.

which occurs in a gas cell filled by alkali vapor in presence of a strong
alternating magnetic field and pump light. Steep increase of the spin
polarization occurs if frequency of the magnetic field is equal to the certain
value. Although, the observable effect relies on the periodic field that
consists of two perpendicular components defined by harmonics with the same
amplitudes and different frequencies. Considered spin effect cannot be
explained by a resonance, because the own Larmor frequency of spin precession
is absent without a constant component of magnetic field. Moreover, there are
some clearly visible peaks in the excitation spectrum of spin polarization, and
they are super narrow in comparison to relaxation rate. Detailed analysis
according to proposed quantum model results in the reasoning of the effect via
qualitative properties of non-adiabatic dynamics of atomic spin.

optimization problems. However, its performance is severely impacted by the
limited connectivity of the underlying quantum hardware, compromising the
quantum speedup. In this work, we present a novel approach to address these
issues, by describing a method to implement non-local couplings throught the
lens of Local Operations and Classical Communcations (LOCC). Non-local
couplings are very versatile, harnessing the configurability of distributed
quantum networks, which in turn lead to great enhancement of the physical
connectivity of the underlying hardware. Furthermore, the realization of
non-local couplings between distinct quantum annealing processors activates the
scalability potential of distributed systems, i.e. allowing for a distributed
quantum annealing system. Finally, in a more distant vision, we also show that
secure multi-party quantum annealing algorithms are possible, allowing for
cooperation of distrusting parties through optimization with quantum annealing
and a particular type of non-local couplings.

                                        <span>  Modeling the underlying pairing mechanism of charge carriers in strongly
correlated electrons, starting from a microscopic theory, is among the central
challenges of condensed-matter physics. Hereby, the key task is to understand
what causes the appearance of superconductivity at comparatively high
temperatures upon hole doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator.
Recently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the
fundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and
bipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing
near-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we
provide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open
and closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a
truncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by
bipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open
channel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows
us analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed)
attraction for hole (electron) doping in our model. The formalism we introduce
provides a framework to analyze the implications of a possible Feshbach
scenario, e.g. in the context of BEC-BCS crossover, and establishes a
foundation to test quantitative aspects of the proposed Feshbach pairing
mechanisms in doped antiferromagnets.

kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium
Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve
remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and
frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT
demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using
a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave
SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see
an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is
the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To
address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using
thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In
this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication
procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added
noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of
approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain
ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in
the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the
gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and
demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3
dB bandwidth.

                                        <span>  Elementary cellular automata (ECA) present iconic examples of complex
systems. Though described only by one-dimensional strings of binary cells
evolving according to nearest-neighbour update rules, certain ECA rules
manifest complex dynamics capable of universal computation. Yet, the
classification of precisely which rules exhibit complex behaviour remains a
significant challenge. Here we approach this question using tools from quantum
stochastic modelling, where quantum statistical memory -- the memory required
to model a stochastic process using a class of quantum machines -- can be used
to quantify the structure of a stochastic process. By viewing ECA rules as
transformations of stochastic patterns, we ask: Does an ECA generate structure
as quantified by the quantum statistical memory, and if so, how quickly? We
illustrate how the growth of this measure over time correctly distinguishes
simple ECA from complex counterparts. Moreover, it provides a more refined
means for quantitatively identifying complex ECAs -- providing a spectrum on
which we can rank the complexity of ECA by the rate in which they generate
structure.

states in trapped ion arrays by coupling to a squeezed state of the collective
motion of the ions. The correlations of the generated spin states can be
tailored for quantum-enhanced sensing of global or differential rotations of
sub-ensembles of the spins by working with specific vibrational modes of the
ion array. We propose a pair of protocols to utilize the generated states and
determine the impact of finite size effects, inhomogeneous couplings between
the spin and motional degrees of freedom and technical noise. Our work suggests
new opportunities for the preparation of many-body states with tailored
correlations for quantum-enhanced metrology in spin-boson systems.

                                        <span>  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a solid-state nanosensing
paradigm. Specifically for high-precision magnetometry, the so-called Ramsey
interferometry is the prevalent choice where the sensing signal is extracted
from time-resolved spin-state-dependent photoluminescence (PL) data. Its
sensitivity is ultimately limited by the photon shot noise, which cannot be
sufficiently removed by averaging or frequency filtering. Here, we propose
Ramsey DC magnetometry of a single NV center enhanced by a wavelet-denoising
scheme specifically tailored to suppress photon shot noise. It simply operates
as a classical post-processing applied on a collected PL time series. Our
implementation is based on a method that we named template margin thresholding
which enables not only frequency but also time-dependent denoising. We
computationally benchmark its DC magnetic field sensing signal-to-noise-ratio
improvement over the raw PL data around an order of magnitude.

in particular, it enables provably secure quantum key distribution (QKD).
Despite the benefits of quantum communication are well understood within the
scientific community, the practical implementations sometimes meet with
scepticism or even resistance. In a recent publication [1], NSA claims that QKD
is inferior to "quantum-resistant" cryptography and does not recommend it for
use. Here we show that such a sceptical approach to evaluation of quantum
security is not well justified. We hope that our arguments will be helpful to
clarify the issue.

                                        <span>  In state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors, each qubit is
controlled by at least one control line that delivers control pulses generated
at room temperature to qubits operating at millikelvin temperatures. While this
strategy has been successfully applied to control hundreds of qubits, it is
unlikely to be scalable to control thousands of qubits, let alone millions or
even billions of qubits needed in fault-tolerance quantum computing. The
primary obstacle lies in the wiring challenge, wherein the number of
accommodated control lines is limited by factors, such as the cooling power,
physical space of the cryogenic system, the control footprint area at the qubit
chip level, and so on. Here, we introduce a multiplexed control architecture
for superconducting qubits with two types of shared control lines, row and
column lines, providing an efficient approach for parallel controlling $N$
qubits with $O(\sqrt{N})$ control lines. With the combination of the two-type
shared lines, unique pairs of control pulses are delivered to qubits at each
row-column intersection, enabling parallel qubit addressing. Of particular
concern here is that, unlike traditional gate schemes, both single- and
two-qubit gates are implemented with pairs of control pulses. Considering the
inherent parallelism and the control limitations, the integration of the
architecture into quantum computing systems should be tailored as much as
possible to the specific properties of the quantum circuits to be executed. As
such, the architecture could be scalable for executing structured quantum
circuits, such as quantum error correction circuits.

                                        <span>  The intricate interplay between unitary evolution and projective measurements
could induce entanglement phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of
quantum many-particle systems. In this work, we uncover loss-induced
entanglement transitions in non-Hermitian topological superconductors. In
prototypical Kitaev chains with local particle losses and varying hopping and
pairing ranges, the bipartite entanglement entropy of steady states is found to
scale logarithmically versus the system size in topologically nontrivial phases
and become independent of the system size in the trivial phase. Notably, the
scaling coefficients of log-law entangled phases are distinguishable when the
underlying system resides in different topological phases. Log-law to log-law
and log-law to area-law entanglement phase transitions are further identified
when the system switches between different topological phases and goes from a
topologically nontrivial to a trivial phase, respectively. These findings not
only establish the relationships among spectral, topological and entanglement
properties in a class of non-Hermitian topological superconductors, but also
provide an efficient means to dynamically reveal their distinctive topological
features.

processors, accurate performance assessment and continuous design optimization
stands at the forefront. To facilitate both meticulous simulation and
streamlined design optimization, we introduce a multi-level simulation
framework that spans both Hamiltonian and quantum error correction levels, and
is equipped with the capability to compute gradients efficiently. This toolset
aids in design optimization, tailored to specific objectives like quantum
memory performance. Within our framework, we investigate the often-neglected
spatially correlated unitary errors, highlighting their significant impact on
logical error rates. We exemplify our approach through the multi-path coupling
scheme of fluxonium qubits.

XYZ chain. We construct a set of chiral vectors with fixed number of kinks. All
vectors are factorized and have simple structures. Under roots of unity
conditions, the Hilbert space has an invariant subspace and our vectors form a
basis of this subspace. We propose a Bethe ansatz solely based on the action of
the Hamiltonian on the chiral vectors, avoiding the use of transfer matrix
techniques. This allows to parameterize the expansion coefficients and derive
the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies
and eigenstates. Our analytic results agree with earlier approaches, notably by
Baxter, and are supported by numerical calculations.

                                        <span>  Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal
inequalities, an analogue of Bell inequalities that constrain the correlations
observed by a set of parties operating in a definite causal order. Since the
introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum
violation, analogue to Tsirelson's bound for Bell inequalities, has remained an
open problem. Here we provide a general method for bounding the violation of
arbitrary causal inequalities, establishing limits on the correlations
achievable by arbitrary local experiments and by arbitrary quantum processes
with indefinite causal order. We prove that the maximum violation is generally
smaller than the algebraic maximum, and determine Tsirelson-like bounds for a
class of causal inequalities including some of the most paradigmatic examples.
Surprisingly, we find that the algebraic maximum of arbitrary causal
inequalities can be achieved by a new type of processes that allow for
information to flow in an indefinite temporal direction within the parties'
laboratories.

                                        <span>  Simulating the dynamics of large quantum systems is a formidable yet vital
pursuit for obtaining a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena.
While quantum computers hold great promise for speeding up such simulations,
their practical application remains hindered by limited scale and pervasive
noise. In this work, we propose an approach that addresses these challenges by
employing circuit knitting to partition a large quantum system into smaller
subsystems that can each be simulated on a separate device. The evolution of
the system is governed by the projected variational quantum dynamics (PVQD)
algorithm, supplemented with constraints on the parameters of the variational
quantum circuit, ensuring that the sampling overhead imposed by the circuit
knitting scheme remains controllable. We test our method on quantum spin
systems with multiple weakly entangled blocks each consisting of strongly
correlated spins, where we are able to accurately simulate the dynamics while
keeping the sampling overhead manageable. Further, we show that the same method
can be used to reduce the circuit depth by cutting long-ranged gates.

                                        <span>  We explore the effects of driving a cavity at a large photon number in a
circuit-QED experiment where the ``matter-like'' part corresponds to an unique
Andreev level in a superconducting weak link. The three many-body states of the
weak link, corresponding to the occupation of the Andreev level by 0, 1 or 2
quasiparticles, lead to different cavity frequency shifts. We show how the
non-linearity inherited by the cavity from its coupling to the weak link
affects the state discrimination and the photon number calibration. Both
effects require treating the evolution of the driven system beyond the
dispersive limit. In addition, we observe how transition rates between the
circuit states (quantum and parity jumps) are affected by the microwave power,
and compare the measurements with a theory accounting for the ``dressing'' of
the Andreev states by the cavity.

                                        <span>  Quantum-enhanced auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) uses output
from a quantum computer to increase the accuracy of its classical counterpart.
The algorithm requires the estimation of overlaps between walker states and a
trial wavefunction prepared on the quantum computer. We study the applicability
of this algorithm in terms of the number of measurements required from the
quantum computer and the classical costs of post-processing those measurements.
We compare the classical post-processing costs of state-of-the-art measurement
schemes using classical shadows to determine the overlaps and argue that the
overall post-processing cost stemming from overlap estimations scales like
$\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ per walker throughout the algorithm. With further numerical
simulations, we compare the variance behavior of the classical shadows when
randomizing over different ensembles, e.g., Cliffords and (particle-number
restricted) matchgates beyond their respective bounds, and uncover the
existence of covariances between overlap estimations of the AFQMC walkers at
different imaginary time steps. Moreover, we include analyses of how the error
in the overlap estimation propagates into the AFQMC energy and discuss its
scaling when increasing the system size.

the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate

nonclassical states of the edge modes.

                                        <span>  Distributed quantum computing supports combining the computational power of
multiple quantum devices to overcome the limitations of individual devices.
Circuit cutting techniques enable the distribution of quantum computations via
classical communication. These techniques involve partitioning a quantum
circuit into smaller subcircuits, each containing fewer qubits. The original
circuit's outcome can be replicated by executing these subcircuits on separate
devices and combining their results. However, the number of circuit executions
required to achieve a fixed result accuracy with circuit cutting grows
exponentially with the number of cuts, posing significant costs. In contrast,
quantum teleportation allows the distribution of quantum computations without
an exponential increase in circuit executions. Nevertheless, each teleportation
requires a pre-shared pair of maximally entangled qubits for transmitting a
quantum state, and non-maximally entangled qubits cannot be used for this
purpose. Addressing this, our work explores utilizing non-maximally entangled
qubit pairs in wire cutting, a specific form of circuit cutting, to mitigate
the associated costs. The cost of this cutting procedure reduces with the
increasing degree of entanglement in the pre-shared qubit pairs. We derive the
optimal sampling overhead in this context and present a wire cutting technique
employing pure non-maximally entangled states that achieves this optimal
sampling overhead. Hence, this offers a continuum between existing wire cutting
and quantum teleportation.

emitters (QEs) via flying photons, quantum interconnect (QI) is essentially a
light-matter interface and acts as a building block in quantum technologies. A
surface plasmon polariton (SPP) supported by a metallic waveguide provides an
ideal interface to explore strong light-matter couplings and to realize QI.
However, the loss of SPP in metal makes the mediated entanglement of the QEs
damp with the increase of the distance and time, which hinders its
applications. We propose a scheme of non-Markovian QI formed by the SPP of a
metallic nanowire. A mechanism to make the generated entanglement of the QEs
persistent is discovered. We find that, as long as bound states are formed in
the energy spectrum of total QE-SPP system, the damping of the SPP-mediated
entanglement is overcome even in the presence of the metal absorption to the
SPP. Our finding enriches our understanding of light-matter couplings in
absorptive medium and paves the way for using the SPP in designing QI.

subspace protected from the dominant dissipative channels. We cast the residual
fidelity loss, induced by a combination of dissipation and non-adiabatic
transitions, in the form of a classical action where the time-dependent control
parameters act as coordinates. This allows us to apply the least action
principle, yielding the fidelity upper-bound and the corresponding optimal
transfer time. As an application, we analyze a system of two qubits subject to
weak relaxation and dephasing, interacting through a strongly dissipative
quantum bus. In this case, our formalism, we obtain a full characterization of

                                        <span>  Average circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) was introduced by Flammia in
arXiv:2108.05803 as a protocol to characterize the Pauli error channels of
individual gates across the device simultaneously. The original paper posed
using ACES to characterize near-term devices as an open problem. This work
advances in this direction by presenting a full implementation of ACES for real
devices and deploying it to Superstaq arXiv:2309.05157, along with a
device-tailored resource estimation obtained through simulations and
experiments. Our simulations show that ACES is able to estimate one- and
two-qubit non-uniform Pauli error channels to an average eigenvalue absolute
error of under $0.003$ and total variation distance of under 0.001 between
simulated and reconstructed probability distributions over Pauli errors with
$10^5$ shots per circuit using 5 circuits of depth 14. The question of
estimating general error channels through twirling techniques in real devices
remains open, as it is dependent on a device's native gates, but simulations
with the Clifford set show results in agreement with reported hardware data.
Experimental results on IBM's Algiers and Osaka devices are presented, where we
characterize their error channels as Pauli channels without twirling.

                                        <span>  The complete reducibility property for bipartite states reduced the
separability problem to a proper subset of positive under partial transpose
states and was used to prove several theorems inside and outside entanglement
theory. So far only three types of bipartite states were proved to possess this
property. In this work, we provide some procedures to create states with this
property, we call these states by the name of completely reducible states. The
convex combination of such states is the first procedure, showing that the set
of completely reducible states is a convex cone. We also provide a complete
description of the extreme rays of this set. Then we show that powers, roots
and partial traces of completely reducible states result in states of the same
type. Finally, we consider a shuffle of states that preserves this property.
This shuffle allows us to construct states with the complete reducibility
property avoiding the only three conditions known to date that imply this
property.

detection/error correction codes by using the infinitely large Hilbert space.
However, due to the encoding, arbitrary gate rotations usually require magic
state teleportation or complicated optimized pulse sequences involving an
ancilla qubit. Here, we propose a simple and hardware-efficient bosonic 02
error detection code that allows for the implementation of arbitrary X and Z
rotations and a controlled phase gate by using a Kerr nonlinear resonator. Our
code can detect a single photon loss, and we observe significant error
suppression by simulating the frequently used hardware-efficient ansatz quantum
circuit in near-term quantum computing.

the presence of decoherence. We study Linbladian evolution in the presence of
both T_1 and T_2 (longitudinal and transverse relaxation processes). We show
that spin squeezing can be an effective way to improve metrological accuracy
even in the presence of decoherence for OAT squeezing. We show our results are
not sensitive to inhomogeneity of the squeezing strength of the many spin OAT
Hamiltonian and that very general squeezed states do not have entanglement
enhanced decoherence. We also extend the Kitagawa-Ueda OAT squeezing formula to
finite polarization.

                                        <span>  Floquet codes are a novel class of quantum error-correcting codes with
dynamically generated logical qubits arising from a periodic schedule of
non-commuting measurements. We utilize the interpretation of measurements in
terms of condensation of topological excitations and the rewinding of
measurement sequences to engineer new examples of Floquet codes. In particular,
rewinding is advantageous for obtaining a desired set of instantaneous
stabilizer groups on both toric and planar layouts. Our first example is a
Floquet code with instantaneous stabilizer codes that have the same topological
order as 3D toric code(s). This Floquet code also exhibits a splitting of the
topological order of the 3D toric code under the associated sequence of
measurements, i.e., an instantaneous stabilizer group of a single copy of 3D
toric code in one round transforms into an instantaneous stabilizer group of
two copies of 3D toric codes up to nonlocal stabilizers in the following round.
We further construct boundaries for this 3D code and argue that stacking it
with two copies of 3D subsystem toric code allows for a transversal
implementation of the logical non-Clifford $CCZ$ gate. We also show that the
coupled-layer construction of the X-cube Floquet code can be modified by a
rewinding schedule such that each of the instantaneous stabilizer codes is
finite-depth-equivalent to the X-cube model up to toric codes; the X-cube
Floquet code exhibits a splitting of the X-cube model into a copy of the X-cube
model and toric codes under the measurement sequence. Our final 3D example is a
generalization of the 2D Floquet toric code on the honeycomb lattice to 3D,
which has instantaneous stabilizer codes with the same topological order as the
3D fermionic toric code.

nonlocal games. In particular, we show that near-perfect quantum strategies are
approximate representations of the corresponding BCS algebra in the little
Frobenius norm. Likewise, for the class of XOR nonlocal games, we show that
near-optimal quantum strategies are approximate representations of the
corresponding *-algebra associated with the game. In both cases, the norm of
the approximate representations is independent of the quantum state employed in
the strategy. We also show that approximate representations of the BCS (resp.
XOR-algebra) are close to near-perfect (resp. near-optimal) quantum strategies
employing a maximally entangled state for the corresponding game. As a
corollary, any near-perfect BCS (resp. near-optimal XOR) quantum strategy is
close to a near-perfect (resp. near-optimal) quantum strategy using a maximally
entangled state. Lastly, we show that every synchronous algebra is *-isomorphic
to a certain BCS algebra, allowing us to apply our results to the class of
synchronous nonlocal games as well.

                                        <span>  With the advent of digital and analog quantum simulation experiments, it is
now possible to experimentally simulate dynamics of quantum many-body lattice
systems and make site-resolved measurements. These experiments make it
pertinent to consider the probability of getting any specific measurement
outcome, which we call the `signal', on placing multiple detectors at various
sites while simulating dynamics of a quantum many-body lattice system. In this
work, we formulate and investigate this problem, introducing the concept of
quantum many-body detection probability (QMBDP), which refers to the
probability of detecting a chosen signal at least once in a given time. We show
that, on tuning some Hamiltonian parameters, there can be sharp transition from
a regime where QMBDP $\approx 1$, to a regime, where QMBDP $\approx 0$. Most
notably, the effects of such a transition can be observed at a single
trajectory level. This is not a measurement-induced transition, but rather a
non-equilibrium transition reflecting opening of a specific type of gap in the
many-body spectrum. We demonstrate this in a single-impurity non-integrable
model, where changing the many-body interaction strength brings about such a
transition. Our findings suggest that instead of measuring expectation values,
single-shot stroboscopic measurements could be used to observe non-equilibrium
transitions.

                                        <span>  We propose a method to prepare Gaussian wave packets with momentum on top of
the interacting ground state of a fermionic Hamiltonian. Using Givens rotation,
we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout
the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate
our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the
Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the
the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we
characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more
complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we
perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our
method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.

                                        <span>  Randomized measurement protocols, including classical shadows, entanglement
tomography, and randomized benchmarking are powerful techniques to estimate
observables, perform state tomography, or extract the entanglement properties
of quantum states. While unraveling the intricate structure of quantum states
is generally difficult and resource-intensive, quantum systems in nature are
often tightly constrained by symmetries. This can be leveraged by the
symmetry-conscious randomized measurement schemes we propose, yielding clear
advantages over symmetry-blind randomization such as reducing measurement
costs, enabling symmetry-based error mitigation in experiments, allowing
differentiated measurement of (lattice) gauge theory entanglement structure,
and, potentially, the verification of topologically ordered states in existing
and near-term experiments. Crucially, unlike symmetry-blind randomized
measurement protocols, these latter tasks can be performed without relearning
symmetries via full reconstruction of the density matrix.

                                        <span>  We obtain the reduced density matrix of a resistively shunted Josephson
junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary
time - an exact numerical scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence
functional. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction
makes it more superconducting. We find no trace of the Schmid
superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in
the RSJ. This work confirms theoretically a similar conclusion drawn in 2020 by
Murani et al., based on experimental observations. We reveal that resistors
with no UV cutoff always yield a fully localized phase and we explain how
previous works predicting an insulating state came to obtain a contrary result.

                                        <span>  Quantum computers are highly susceptible to errors due to unintended
interactions with their environment. It is crucial to correct these errors
without gaining information about the quantum state, which would result in its
destruction through back-action. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides
information about occurred errors without compromising the quantum state of the
system. However, the implementation of QEC has proven to be challenging due to
the current performance levels of qubits -- break-even requires fabrication and
operation quality that is beyond the state-of-the-art. Understanding how qubit
performance factors into the success of a QEC code is a valuable exercise for
tracking progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we present
qec_code_sim, an open-source, lightweight Python framework for studying the
performance of small quantum error correcting codes under the influence of a
realistic error model appropriate for superconducting transmon qubits, with the
goal of enabling useful hardware studies and experiments. qec_code_sim requires
minimal software dependencies and prioritizes ease of use, ease of change, and
pedagogy over execution speed. As such, it is a tool well-suited to small teams
studying systems on the order of one dozen qubits.

fertile platform to explore tunable transport effects of magnons, presenting
significant prospects for spintronic applications. The possibility of having
topologically nontrivial magnons in these systems can further expand the scope
of exploration. In this work, we consider a bilayer system with intralayer
ferromagnetic exchange and a weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange, and
study the topological magnon-polaron excitations induced by magnetoelastic
couplings. Under an applied magnetic field, the system features a metamagnetic
transition, where the magnetic ground state changes from antiparallel layers to
parallel. We show that the metamagnetic transition is accompanied by a
transition of the topological structure of the magnon polarons, which results
in discernible changes in the topology induced transport effects. The
magnetic-field dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst
coefficient is analyzed with linear response theories.

                                        <span>  Gaussian Boson Sampling is a promising method for experimental demonstrations
of quantum advantage because it is easier to implement than other comparable
schemes. While most of the properties of Gaussian Boson Sampling are understood
to the same degree as for these other schemes, we understand relatively little
about the statistical properties of its output distribution. The most relevant
statistical property, from the perspective of demonstrating quantum advantage,
is the anticoncentration of the output distribution as measured by its second
moment. The degree of anticoncentration features in arguments for the
complexity-theoretic hardness of Gaussian Boson Sampling, and it is also
important to know when using cross-entropy benchmarking to verify experimental
performance. In this work, we develop a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing
the moments of the Gaussian Boson Sampling distribution. Using this framework,
we show that Gaussian Boson Sampling undergoes a transition in
anticoncentration as a function of the number of modes that are initially
squeezed compared to the number of photons measured at the end of the circuit.
When the number of initially squeezed modes scales sufficiently slowly with the
number of photons, there is a lack of anticoncentration. However, if the number
of initially squeezed modes scales quickly enough, the output probabilities
anticoncentrate weakly.

                                        <span>  The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum
systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum
technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in
order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative
master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the
system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield
sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In
particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very
accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak
and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master
equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of
heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration.
This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of
perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master
equations does not involve additional complications when compared with
alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure
thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.

with a flat co-dimension one boundary are discussed, particularly a case where
the boundary condition preserves scale and translation invariance but violates
the residual Lorentz and conformal symmetries. This case is interesting because
the Dirac equation has normalizable stationary edge states which must be taken
into account in the quantization. We show that a consequence of the edge states
for quantization of the Dirac field is that there are no states of the Dirac
field theory which are simultaneously scale, C and P invariant even when these
are good symmetries of the theory. The scale invariant states of the Dirac
field contain either a nonzero scale covariant momentum density or a U(1)
charge density concentrated near the edge.

that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda =
\lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C
\lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on
manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however,
only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the
present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a
generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to
the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

exceptional role in the space of all $n$-qubit/qudit states. We establish
uncertainty principles for the characteristic function and the Wigner function
of states, respectively. We find that only stabilizer states achieve saturation
in these principles. Furthermore, we prove a general theorem that stabilizer
states are extremal for convex information measures invariant under local
unitaries. We explore this extremality in the context of various quantum
information and correlation measures, including entanglement entropy,
conditional entropy and other entanglement measures. Additionally, leveraging
the recent discovery that stabilizer states are the limit states under quantum
convolution, we establish the monotonicity of the entanglement entropy and
conditional entropy under quantum convolution. These results highlight the
remarkable information-theoretic properties of stabilizer states. Their
extremality provides valuable insights into their ability to capture
information content and correlations, paving the way for further exploration of
their potential in quantum information processing.

                                        <span>  Strong converse theorems refer to the study of impossibility results in
information theory. In particular, Mosonyi and Ogawa established a one-shot
strong converse bound for quantum hypothesis testing [Comm. Math. Phys, 334(3),
2014], which servers as a primitive tool for establishing a variety of tight
strong converse theorems in quantum information theory. In this short note, we
demonstrate an alternative one-line proof for this bound via the variational
expression of measured R\'enyi divergences [Lett. Math. Phys, 107(12), 2017].
Then, we show that the variational expression is a direct consequence of
H\"older's inequality.

                                        <span>  Quantum walks are referred to as quantum analogues to random walks in
mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum
information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is
the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum
walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to
find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of
the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in
long time.

faithfully the non self-adjoint nature of momentum for a particle in a box. Its
eigenfunctions are strictly limited to the interior of the box in the continuum
limit, with the quarter wave as first non-trivial eigenstate. We show how to
construct the corresponding hermitean Hamiltonian for the infinite well as
concrete example to realize unitary dynamics. The resulting Hilbert space can
be decomposed into a physical and unphysical subspace, which are mutually
orthogonal. The physical subspace in the continuum limit reproduces that of the
continuum theory and we give numerical evidence that the correct probability
distributions for momentum and energy are recovered.

                                        <span>  We link the QUMOND theory with the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition and introduce
a new formula for the gradient of the Mondian potential using singular integral
operators. This approach allows us to demonstrate that, under very general
assumptions on the mass distribution, the Mondian potential is well-defined,
once weakly differentiable, with its gradient given through the Helmholtz-Weyl
decomposition. Furthermore, we establish that the gradient of the Mondian
potential is an $L^p$ vector field. These findings lay the foundation for a
rigorous mathematical analysis of various issues within the realm of QUMOND.
Given that the Mondian potential satisfies a second-order partial differential
equation, the question arises whether it has second-order derivatives. We
affirmatively answer this question in the situation of spherical symmetry,
although our investigation reveals that the regularity of the second
derivatives is weaker than anticipated. We doubt that a similarly general
regularity result can be proven without symmetry assumptions. In conclusion, we
explore the implications of our results for numerous problems within the domain
of QUMOND, thereby underlining their potential significance and applicability.

                                        <span>  The research explores a high irregularity, commonly referred to as
intermittency, of the solution to the non-stationary parabolic Anderson
problem: \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \varkappa \mathcal{L}u(t,x) +
\xi_{t}(x)u(t,x) \end{equation*} with the initial condition \(u(0,x) \equiv
1\), where \((t,x) \in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{Z}^d\). Here, \(\varkappa
\mathcal{L}\) denotes a non-local Laplacian, and \(\xi_{t}(x)\) is a correlated
white noise potential. The observed irregularity is intricately linked to the
upper part of the spectrum of the multiparticle Schr\"{o}dinger equations for
the moment functions \(m_p(t,x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_p) = \langle
u(t,x_1)u(t,x_2)\cdots u(t,x_p)\rangle\).
  In the first half of the paper, a weak form of intermittency is expressed
through moment functions of order $p\geq 3$ and established for a wide class of
operators $\varkappa \mathcal{L}$ with a positive-definite correlator $B=B(x))$
of the white noise. In the second half of the paper, the strong intermittency
is studied. It relates to the existence of a positive eigenvalue for the
lattice Schr\"odinger type operator with the potential $B$. This operator is
associated with the second moment $m_2$. Now $B$ is not necessarily
positive-definite, but $\sum B(x)\geq 0$.

which make substantial points that I believe are original, and which have not
been made in the literature. To take just one example, it is known by some
people that Kolmogorov's 1962 theory is not correctly described as a
'refinement' of his 1941 theory. This was pointed out by Kraichnan in 1974.
However, what does not appear to have been recognized is that the 1962 theory
is physically invalid, and also that a plausible implementation of it destroys
the Kolmogorov (1941) scaling of energy spectra which has been widely observed
over many years. This is discussed in Section 4 below. Lastly, I have tried to
give an informal treatment in order to make everything easily accessible, to
reach the widest possible audience. In particular, the section on
renormalization methods is written without giving the equations of the various
theories, merely stating in words what has been done, what are the different
methods and also what still needs to be done.

                                        <span>  Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era,
we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits.
We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively
logarithmic depth, in the task of computing Pauli expectation values. We then
prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren
plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging
the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate
Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high
probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and
it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional
architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken
together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits
to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are
preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli
expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning
proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable
insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling
from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.

applicability to non-periodic boundary conditions. Our method handles free
space boundary conditions by replacing the Fourier Laplacian operator in PIF
with a mollified Green's function as first introduced by
Vico-Greengard-Ferrando. This modification yields highly accurate free space
solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, while still maintaining energy
conservation up to an error bounded by the time step size. We also explain how
to extend our scheme to arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions via standard
potential theory, which we illustrate in detail for Dirichlet boundary
conditions on a circular boundary. We support our approach with
proof-of-concept numerical results from two-dimensional plasma test cases to
demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and conservation properties of the
scheme.

both, the state of other emitters and the state of the surrounding radiation.
Such instances combine two central topics in quantum optics that are typically
treated separately: collective decay and non-Markovian dynamics. Here we access
collective non-Markovian decay through the exact solution for two excited
quantum emitters located at adjacent unit cells of a one-dimensional
single-band waveguide. The transformed field amplitudes, which we express in
terms of elementary functions, combine exponential, algebraic, fractional, and
mixed algebraic-exponential decay, as well as logarithmic corrections to some
of the algebraic parts. We develop analytic methods for multiparticle open
quantum systems that shed light on the complexity of non-linear quantum optical
phenomena.

straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion
in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field
profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the
metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on
Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical

nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated
perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and
electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and
obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of
obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the

                                        <span>  We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations
which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations.
Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant
algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of
generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of
Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is
used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant
algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence
and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming
from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard
T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it
applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian
manifolds.

                                        <span>  A chiral coordinate Bethe ansatz method is developed to study the periodic
XYZ chain. We construct a set of chiral vectors with fixed number of kinks. All
vectors are factorized and have simple structures. Under roots of unity
conditions, the Hilbert space has an invariant subspace and our vectors form a
basis of this subspace. We propose a Bethe ansatz solely based on the action of
the Hamiltonian on the chiral vectors, avoiding the use of transfer matrix
techniques. This allows to parameterize the expansion coefficients and derive
the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies
and eigenstates. Our analytic results agree with earlier approaches, notably by
Baxter, and are supported by numerical calculations.

                                        <span>  In 2018, Vladimir Fock and the author introduced a geometric structure on
surfaces, called higher complex structure, whose moduli space shares several
properties with Hitchin's component. In this paper, we establish various links
between flat connections and higher complex structures.
  In particular, we study a certain class of connections on a bundle equipped
with a line subbundle $L$, which we call $L$-parabolic. These connections are
almost flat, and allow a local standard form. A certain family of $L$-parabolic
connections is parametrized by the data of a higher complex structure and a
cotangent variation. The family of connections being flat implies the
compatibility condition of the cotangent variation. Higher diffeomorphisms are
realized by the gauge transformation induced by changing $L$. Constructing flat
families of connections of this kind is linked to Toda integrable systems.

                                        <span>  I present here a pedagogical introduction to the works by Rashel Tublin and
Yan V. Fyodorov on random linear systems with quadratic constraints, using
tools from Random Matrix Theory and replicas. These notes illustrate and
complement the material presented at the Summer School organised within the
Puglia Summer Trimester 2023 in Bari (Italy). Consider a system of $M$ linear
equations in $N$ unknowns, $\sum_{j=1}^N A_{kj}x_j=b_k$ for $k=1,\ldots,M$,
subject to the constraint that the solutions live on the $N$-sphere,
$x_1^2+\ldots + x_N^2=N$. Assume that both the coefficients $A_{ij}$ and the
parameters $b_i$ be independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Using
two different approaches -- based on Random Matrix Theory and on a replica
calculation -- it is possible to compute whether a large linear system subject
to a quadratic constraint is typically solvable or not, as a function of the
ratio $\alpha=M/N$ and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the $b_i$'s. This is done by
defining a quadratic loss function $H({\bf
x})=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^M\left[\sum_{j=1}^NA_{kj} x_j-b_k\right]^2$ and
computing the statistics of its minimal value on the sphere,
$E_{min}=\min_{||\bf x||^2=N}H({\bf x})$, which is zero if the system is
compatible, and larger than zero if it is incompatible. One finds that there
exists a compatibility threshold $0<\alpha_c<1$, such that systems with
$\alpha>\alpha_c$ are typically incompatible. This means that even weakly
under-complete linear systems could become typically incompatible if forced to
additionally obey a quadratic constraint.

                                        <span>  Given a C$^*$-algebra $A$ with an almost periodic time evolution $\sigma$, we
define a new C$^*$-algebra $A_c$, which we call the crystal of $(A,\sigma)$,
that represents the zero temperature limit of $(A, \sigma)$. We prove that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ground states of $(A,\sigma)$
and the states on $A_c$, justifying the name. In order to investigate further
the relation between low temperature equilibrium states on $A$ and traces on
$A_c$, we define a Fock module $\mathcal F$ over the crystal and construct a
vacuum representation of $A$ on $\mathcal F$. This allows us to show, under
relatively mild assumptions, that for sufficiently large inverse temperatures
$\beta$ the $\sigma$-KMS$_\beta$-states on $A$ are induced from traces on $A_c$
by means of the Fock module. In the second part, we compare the K-theoretic
structures of $A$ and $A_c$. Previous work by various authors suggests that
they have (rationally) isomorphic K-groups. We analyze this phenomenon in
detail, confirming it under favorable conditions, but showing that, in general,
there is apparently no easy way to relate these groups. As examples, we discuss
in particular Exel's results on semi-saturated circle actions, and recent
results of Miller on the K-theory of inverse semigroup C$^*$-algebras. In
relation to the latter, we introduce the notion of a scale $N$ on an inverse
semigroup $I$ and define a new inverse semigroup $I_c$, which we call the
crystal of $(I,N)$.

with a flat co-dimension one boundary are discussed, particularly a case where
the boundary condition preserves scale and translation invariance but violates
the residual Lorentz and conformal symmetries. This case is interesting because
the Dirac equation has normalizable stationary edge states which must be taken
into account in the quantization. We show that a consequence of the edge states
for quantization of the Dirac field is that there are no states of the Dirac
field theory which are simultaneously scale, C and P invariant even when these
are good symmetries of the theory. The scale invariant states of the Dirac
field contain either a nonzero scale covariant momentum density or a U(1)
charge density concentrated near the edge.

holographic 2d CFTs. In the bulk, the propagator of free fields in AdS
backgrounds containing a conical defect or a BTZ black hole can be obtained by
solving the wave equation, as well as by the method of images. On the boundary,
these geometries are sourced by heavy operator insertions, and the propagator
is dual to a heavy-light (HHLL) correlator. By matching its expansion in
Virasoro blocks to our bulk results, we determine the OPE coefficients of all
contributing states in both the s and t channels. In the s channel, these
states are excitations of the light field on top of the heavy state, and their
OPE coefficients are the amplitudes to create them. The t-channel OPE is
dominated by the Virasoro vacuum block, but there is also an infinite family of
light two-particle states that contribute to the correlator. The OPE
coefficients that couple these states to heavy operators represent their
expectation values in heavy backgrounds. We determine them exactly, derive
their asymptotic form at large twist, and discuss their behavior near and above
the BTZ threshold, where they become thermal one-point functions.

                                        <span>  In this thesis, we aim to investigate the mechanisms underlying the genesis
of magnetic fields in the Universe and explore their potential in addressing
the matter-antimatter asymmetry. We construct consistent models that generate
the helical magnetic field consistent with observations. We also develop an
effective field theory approach to magnetogenesis, where the choice of EFT
parameters describes the magnetogenesis scenario in the early Universe, and
different choices of parameters correspond to different models. Our EFT
explicitly shows that generating primordial magnetic fields requires two
necessary conditions: conformal invariance breaking and causal propagation.
Furthermore, we establish that the presence of a strong magnetic field near
compact objects, such as neutron stars, aids in understanding the phenomenon of
Fast radio bursts through the conversion of gravitational waves to
electromagnetic waves in the background of a strong transverse magnetic field.

                                        <span>  The computation of two-loop amplitudes for the production of multiple Higgs
and electroweak gauge bosons via gluon fusion with exact dependence on quark
masses relies primarily on numerical methods. We propose a framework that
enables their numerical evaluation in momentum space. The method is inspired by
the factorization of infrared divergences in QCD scattering amplitudes. It
extends techniques introduced for electroweak gauge boson production from
quark-antiquark annihilation to processes with external gluons. By combining
diagrammatic integrands, we make use of local cancellations between diagrams
that automatically eliminate most non-factoring infrared singularities. With a
limited number of counterterms, we then derive two-loop integrands for which
all soft and collinear singularities factorize locally. We hope that the local
subtraction techniques presented in this article will play a useful role in
extending the local factorization formalism to two-loop amplitudes for
arbitrary processes.

renormalized strong coupling via the gradient flow. This is done adopting the
Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to deal with the infamous topological
freezing problem that affects standard local updating algorithms. We show that,
even in the presence of severe topological freezing, both algorithms yield the
same strong coupling once projected onto a fixed topological sector. Moreover,
we show that using a non-projected definition of the coupling leads to the same
step-scaling sequence. This means that projecting the coupling onto a fixed
topological sector does not affect the determination of the
dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$.

particle emerging from a thermal horizon of a hot
NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Anti-de Sitter (HNKNK-AdS) black hole. Considering the
tunneling formalism, we report the Hawking temperature of the charged Dirac
particle through the horizon and the heat capacity of the HNKNK-AdS black hole.
It is found that the effective Hawking temperature for the black hole depends
on the black hole's parameters, such as electric and magnetic charges, magnetic
mass, the cosmological constant, and the angular momentum of the black hole.
The Hawking radiation for the Kerr-Newman black hole is reduced. It is shown
that there is a small correction to the Hawking thermal spectrum. The heat
capacity for the HNKNK-AdS black hole is found different from the previous
work, and for the Kerr-Newman black hole is also reduced.

                                        <span>  In recent years, the physics of many-body quantum chaotic systems close to
their ground states has come under intensified scrutiny. Such studies are
motivated by the emergence of model systems exhibiting chaotic fluctuations
throughout the entire spectrum (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model being a
renowned representative) as well as by the physics of holographic principles,
which likewise unfold close to ground states. Interpreting the edge of the
spectrum as a quantum critical point, here we combine a wide range of
analytical and numerical methods to the identification and comprehensive
description of two different universality classes: the near edge physics of
``sparse'' and the near edge of ``dense'' chaotic systems. The distinction lies
in the ratio between the number of a system's random parameters and its Hilbert
space dimension, which is exponentially small or algebraically small in the
sparse and dense case, respectively. Notable representatives of the two classes
are generic chaotic many-body models (sparse) and single particle systems,
invariant random matrix ensembles, or chaotic gravitational systems (dense).
While the two families share identical spectral correlations at energy scales
comparable to the level spacing, the density of states and its fluctuations
near the edge are different. Considering the SYK model as a representative of
the sparse class, we apply a combination of field theory and exact
diagonalization to a detailed discussion of its edge spectrum. Conversely,
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is our reference model for the dense class, where an
analysis of the gravitational path integral and random matrix theory reveal
universal differences to the sparse class, whose implications for the
construction of holographic principles we discuss.

                                        <span>  Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the
$\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole
moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been
found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP
problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the
extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta > 0$ at large
distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole
moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the
infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological
charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a
limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the
inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero
mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies, beyond doubt, that CP is conserved
in the strong interaction.

                                        <span>  We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of
stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its
impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin
equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by
the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent
Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic
duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An
explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the
stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and
quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we
perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL},
g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the
diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution
featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.

with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep
generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show
how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of
the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates.
We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions
oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how,
in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies
and reproduces that known perturbatively.

                                        <span>  We reveal the presence of a new source of axial current due to the condensed
vacuum generated
  by the spin-spin interaction. To show this, we consider a quartic Dirac
Lagrangian containing a
  spin-spin interaction term, possibly originating from torsion in
Einstein-Cartan-like theories. We
  use a mean field approach to analyze the quantized theory. We show that the
diagonalization of the
  field Hamiltonian defines a new vacuum state, energetically favored with
respect to the free vacuum.
  Such a vacuum, which is a condensate of particle-antiparticle pairs, is
characterized by a nontrivial
  expectation value of the axial current operator. The new source of axial
current, here obtained, can
  have effects both at the atomic level and at the astrophysical-cosmological
level depending on the
  origin of the spin-spin interaction term. The condensate may affect the dark
sector of the universe
  at cosmological level and the axial current originated by the vacuum
condensate could be analyzed
  in next table top experiments on graphene

four dimensional (4D) effective description of higher-dimensional theory. We
consider a charged massless complex scalar coupled to U(1) gauge theory in
$\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times {\mathbb S}^1$ and discuss the effect of background
gauge potential along a compact direction. The electric field produces the
charged particle non-perturbatively, which we call Kaluza-Klein (KK) Schwinger
effect. We quantitatively show that KK modes can be produced even when the
electric field energy is much below the KK scale. The mechanism is rather
general and similar phenomena would occur in any compactification models when a
gauge potential along compact direction evolves in time and experiences large
enough field excursion.

state in toric code model evolving through a projective measurement-only
circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding
to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which
is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a
cylinder geometry to classify stationary states after long-time measurement
dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities
for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases exist
in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both the Higgs and confined
phases are clearly separated from the deconfined phase by topological
entanglement entropy, whereas the phase boundary between the Higgs and confined
phases is obtained by long-range orders on the boundaries supporting the recent
observation that the Higgs and confined phases are both one of
symmetry-protected-topological states.

                                        <span>  Considering the nonminimal coupling of dilaton field to the massive graviton
field in Maxwell-dilaton-Massive gravity, we obtain a class of analytical
solutions of charged black holes, which are neither asymptotically flat nor
(A)dS. The calculated thermodynamic quantities, such as mass, temperature and
entropy, verify the valid of first law of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover,
we further investigate the critical behaviors of these black holes in grand
canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble, respectively, and find that there is
a new and novel critical phenomenon which is never found before, called
``reversed" reentrant phase transition with a tricritical point. It implies
that the system undergoes a novel ``SBH-LBH-SBH" phase transition process, and
is the reverse of the ``LBH-SBH-LBH" process observed in reentrant phase
transitions.

                                        <span>  Recently we have introduced a lightweight, perturbative approach to quantum
solitons. Thus far, our approach has been largely limited to configurations
consisting of a single soliton plus a finite number of mesons, whose classical
limit is an isolated stationary or rigidly moving soliton. In this paper, with
an eye to soliton collisions and oscillons, we generalize this approach to
quantum states whose classical limits are genuinely time-dependent. More
precisely, we use a unitary operator, inspired by the coherent state approach
to solitons, to factor out the nonperturbative part of the state, which
includes the classical motion. The solution for the quantum state and its
evolution is then reduced to an entirely perturbative problem.

gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in
perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de
Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric
series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees
within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a
Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative
computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges
to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.

through the lens of the quantum theory of gravitational interaction. The
historical part argues that the search for a theory of quantum gravity
stimulated the change in outlook that characterizes the modern approach to the
Standard Model of particle physics and General Relativity. We present some
landmarks covering a long period, i.e., from the beginning of the 1930s until
1994, when, according to Steven Weinberg, the modern bottom-up approach to
General Relativity began. Starting from the first attempt to apply the quantum
field theory techniques to perturbatively quantize Einstein's theory, we
explore its developments and interaction with the top-down approach encoded by
String Theory. In the last part of the paper, we focus on this last approach to
describe the relationship between our modern understanding of String Theory and
Effective Field Theory in today's panorama. To this end, the non-historical
part briefly explains the modern concepts of moduli stabilization and Swampland
to understand another change in focus that explains the present framework where
some string theorists move.

                                        <span>  Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological
characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters,
loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the
Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the
joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information
content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a
Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter
for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the
two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in
constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to
consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating
persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.

of multicritical matrix models in the $\beta=1$ Dyson-Wigner class. They
capture the physics of 2D quantum gravity coupled to minimal matter on
unorientable surfaces, otherwise called unoriented minimal strings. We derive a
formula for the density of states valid to all orders in perturbation theory.
We show how to define an interpolation between the multicritical models and
that a certain interpolation among an infinite number of them provides an
alternative definition of unoriented JT gravity. We discuss the strengths and
weaknesses of our formulation.

                                        <span>  We investigated non-linear sigma models with cosets G/H represented by
$SU(N)\times SU(N)/SU(N)$, $SU(N)/SO(N)$, and $SU(2N)/USp(2N)$. These models
exhibit a transition to a strongly coupled regime above a threshold energy
scale $\Lambda^*$, where the effective field theory approach breaks down. To
address this issue, we introduced the so called Higgs radial modes within the
Linear Sigma Model, crucial for restoring perturbative unitarity. Analyzing the
$N>2$ case, we first notice that all radial modes coming from the most general
irreducible representation of G are necessary for unitarizing scattering
amplitudes and ensuring the weakly coupled nature of the theory. The
phenomenology behind these extra radial modes recalls the physics of the Higgs
in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. In the case of a model
describing electroweak symmetry breaking with a more complex pattern, despite
strict constraints from electroweak precision tests, these modes could
stabilize the Higgs potential and be a possible solution for the vacuum
instability issue.

simple two-point functions in the probe approximation. We find that de Sitter
equilibrates in a superdiffusive manner, unlike most physical systems which
equilibrate diffusively. We also examine the scrambling time. In de Sitter, the
two-point functions of free fields do not decay for sometime because quanta can
reflect off the pole of the static patch. This suggests a minimum scrambling
time of the order $\log(1/G_N)$, even for perturbations introduced on the
stretched horizon, indicating fast scrambling inside de Sitter static patch. We
also discuss the interplay between thermodynamic temperature and inverse
correlation time, sometimes called "tomperature".

theory in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Weyl invariance allows for this
theory to be embedded as a patch inside the Einstein static universe. We use
conformal inversions to extend the conformal primary solutions of the equations
of motion labelled by a boost-weight $\Delta = 1 + i\lambda$ to an inverted
Minkowski patch centered at spacelike infinity of the original patch. For
$\lambda \neq 0$ these solutions admit an expansion in terms of wavefunctions
supported in the (future) Milne wedges of the original and inverted Minkowski
patches, that diagonalize the respective Milne times. The Minkowski vacuum can
then be described as a thermofield double state on these two Milne wedges. We
characterize the soft sectors of $\lambda = 0$ modes supported in the two Milne
wedges. Upon reinterpreting the non-pure gauge $\lambda = 0$ wavefunctions as
sourced by image charges in the inverse Minkowski patch, we construct an
appropriate entangling constraint in the Minkowski theory, thereby
characterizing the physical state space. We show that the edge mode
contribution to the vacuum entanglement entropy is due to correlations between
the soft charges of the two Milne patches, or equivalently non-trivial
conformally soft mode configurations at the entangling surface.

                                        <span>  A new hierarchy of lasting gravitational-wave effects (the higher memory
effects) was recently identified in asymptotically flat spacetimes, with the
better-known displacement, spin, and center-of-mass memory effects included as
the lowest two orders in the set of these effects. These gravitational-wave
observables are determined by a set of temporal moments of the news tensor,
which describes gravitational radiation from an isolated source. The moments of
the news can be expressed in terms of changes in charge-like expressions and
integrals over retarded time of flux-like terms, some of which vanish in the
absence of radiation. In this paper, we compute expressions for the flux-like
contributions to the moments of the news in terms of a set of multipoles that
characterize the gravitational-wave strain. We also identify a part of the
strain that gives rise to these moments of the news. In the context of
post-Newtonian theory, we show that the strain related to the moments of the
news is responsible for the many nonlinear, instantaneous terms and "memory"
terms that appear in the post-Newtonian expressions for the radiative multipole
moments of the strain. We also apply our results to compute the leading
post-Newtonian expressions for the moments of the news and the corresponding
strains that are generated during the inspiral of compact binary sources. These
results provide a new viewpoint on the waveforms computed from the multipolar
post-Minkowski formalism, and they could be used to assess the detection
prospects of this new class of higher memory effects.

a novel category known as topological dipole insulators (TDIs), characterized
by conserved dipole moments along the $x$-direction in addition to charge
conservation. By generalizing Laughlin's flux insertion argument, we prove a
no-go theorem and predict possible edge patterns and anomalies in a TDI with
both charge $U^e(1)$ and dipole $U^d(1)$ symmetries. The edge of a TDI is
characterized as a quadrupolar channel that displays a dipole $U^d(1)$ anomaly.
A quantized amount of dipole gets transferred between the edges under the
dipolar flux insertion, manifesting as `quantized quadrupolar Hall effect' in
TDIs. A microscopic coupled-wire Hamiltonian realizing the TDI is constructed
by introducing a mutually commuting pair-hopping terms between wires to gap out
all the bulk modes while preserving the dipole moment. The effective action at
the quadrupolar edge can be derived from the wire model, with the corresponding
bulk dipolar Chern-Simons response theory delineating the topological
electromagnetic response in TDIs. Finally, we enrich our exploration of
topological dipole insulators to the spinful case and construct a dipolar
version of the quantum spin Hall effect, whose boundary evidences a mixed
anomaly between spin and dipole symmetry. Effective bulk and the edge action
for the dipolar quantum spin Hall insulator are constructed as well.

random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a
holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity.
Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be
feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of
reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified
version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with
probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form
factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair
correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$
(characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We
find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as
$1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full
unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But
for $p<p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a
breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller
value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive
eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral
rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very
highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation
infidelity as a loss function.

                                        <span>  We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D)
topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that
the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological
order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground
state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence,
previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is
more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out"
anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons
generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric
under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking
connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem
codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders.
Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a
classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and
even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered
states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a
partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.

$AdS_5 \times S^3$ to all orders in $\alpha'$ in a small curvature expansion.
This is achieved by combining a dispersion relation in the dual $4d$
$\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with an ansatz for the amplitude as a worldsheet integral
in terms of multiple polylogarithms. The first curvature correction is fully
fixed in this way and satisfies consistency checks in the high energy limit,
the low energy expansion as previously fixed using supersymmetric localisation,
and for the energy of massive string operators, which we independently compute
using a semiclassical expansion. We also combine localisation with this first
curvature correction to fix the unprotected $D^4F^4$ correction to the
amplitude at finite curvature.

corrections to the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering process in
perturbative quantum chromodynamics. We consider the quark initiated flavor

leading color. All relevant virtual and real emission Feynman diagrams have
been computed using integration-by-parts reduction to master integrals and two

and method of differential equations). The numerical analysis demonstrates the
significance of the NNLO corrections and their great impact on the reduction of
the residual scale dependence.

Dirichlet boundary conditions on both ends. By invoking the 3D ``twisted

that the vertex algebras of boundary operators are enhanced by the line
operators. A full non-perturbative result is found in the abelian case, where
the chiral algebra is given by the rank two Narain lattice VOA, and two more
equivalent descriptions are provided. Conjectures and speculations on the

analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without
the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role
of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. For an arbitrary
number of fields we derive the criteria that can lead to an exponential
amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving
the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results
on a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light" scenario and show how the
presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the

                                        <span>  The spacetime short-distance structure at the Planck scale is governed by the
Planck length, usually interpreted as a three-dimensional Euclidian length. As
such, it is not Lorentz invariant and clashes with Einstein's special
relativity, which is thus unable to describe the Planck scale kinematics. The
solution to this problem is twofold. First, one has to re-interpret the Planck
length as a Lorentz invariant four-dimensional pseudo-length. Second, to comply
with a non-vanishing cosmological term~$\Lambda$, one has to replace the
standard Poincar\'e-invariant special relativity with the de Sitter-invariant
special relativity. Since the Planck pseudo-length does not clash with the de
Sitter-invariant special relativity, it provides a consistent description of
the Planck scale kinematics in the presence of~$\Lambda$. Under the above
replacement, general relativity changes to the de Sitter-invariant general
relativity, in which~$\Lambda$ is constitutive. In this paper, the ensuing
Friedmann equations are derived, and some implications for cosmology are
explored and discussed.

                                        <span>  Higher-group symmetries are combinations of higher-form symmetries which
appear in various field theories. In this paper, we explain how higher-group
symmetries arise in 10d and 11d supergravities when the latter are coupled to
brane sources. Motivated by this observation, we study field theories at zero
and finite temperature invariant under a class of continuous Abelian
higher-group symmetries. We restrict the analysis to the low-energy regime
where the dynamical field content exclusively consists of Goldstone fields
arising from the spontaneous breaking of higher-group and spacetime symmetries.
Invariant quantities are constructed and the phases of matter are classified
according to the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With respect to
supergravity, we highlight how such Goldstone effective theories provide a
symmetry-based interpretation for the theories living on D/M-branes. As an
explicit example we construct a 6-group invariant action for the bosonic M5
brane, consistent with the self-duality of the 3-form field strength on the
brane. While the self-duality condition in the bosonic case needs to be imposed
externally as a constraint at zero temperature, we find an equilibrium
effective action for the bosonic M5 brane at finite temperature that inherently
implements self-duality.

                                        <span>  We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of
modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a
straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion
in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field
profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the
metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on
Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical
symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all
nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated
perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and
electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and
obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of
obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the
scalar-vector-tensor theory.

region of the Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensional spacetime. Under the
Newman-Unti gauge, we derive the most general near horizon symmetry and
solution space without any near horizon fall-off condition. There are four
towers of surface charges that are generic functions on the horizon associated
to the near horizon symmetry. With suitable near horizon fall-off conditions,
we reveal a soft graviton theorem from the Ward identity of the near horizon
supertranslation in both coordinates space and momentum space.

which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations.
Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant
algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of
generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of
Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is
used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant
algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence
and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming
from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard
T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it
applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian
manifolds.

non-linear self-interactions within an effective field theory (EFT) of

constructing a UV-regulated EFT. The relaxation time of this UV mode is
protected from renormalization, as supported by experimental data in a bad

acquires four branch points, eventually increasing the range of applicability.
We discuss the fate of long-time-tails as well as implications for the quark

                                        <span>  We extend the notion of regularized integrals introduced by Li-Zhou that aims
to assign finite values to divergent integrals on configuration spaces of
Riemann surfaces. We then give cohomological formulations for the extended
notion using the tools of current cohomology and mixed Hodge structures. We
also provide practical ways of constructing representatives of the
corresponding cohomology classes in terms of smooth differential forms.

                                        <span>  We construct a new Yang-Mills Lagrangian based on a notion of minimal
coupling that incorporates classical spin effects. The construction relies on
the introduction of a new covariant derivative, which we name "classical spin
covariant derivative", that is compatible with the three-point interaction of
the $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$ solution with the gauge field. The resulting
Lagrangian, beside the correct three-point coupling, predicts a unique choice
for contact terms and therefore it can be used to compute higher-point
amplitudes such as the Compton, unaffected by spurious poles. Using double-copy
techniques we use this theory to extract gravity amplitudes and observables
that are relevant to describe Kerr binary dynamics to all orders in the spin.
In particular, we compute the 2PM ($\mathcal{O}(G^2_N)$) $2\rightarrow 2$
scattering amplitude between two classically spinning objects to all orders in
the spin and use it to extract the 2PM scattering angle.

                                        <span>  In view to scrutinize the idea that nonlocal modifications of General
Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate
the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative
Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late
Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational
effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the
mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed
and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable
predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the
effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal
gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address
the dark energy problem.

                                        <span>  Panic-induced herding in individuals often leads to social disasters,
resulting in people being trapped and trampled in crowd stampedes triggered by
panic. We introduce a novel approach that offers fresh insights into studying
the phenomenon of asymmetrical panic-induced escape. Our approach is based on
the concept of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a fundamental governing
mechanism in the Physical Sciences. By applying the principles of SSB, we
elucidate how asymmetrical panic-induced herding in individuals occurs. We
highlight that understanding panic escape and preventing catastrophic
situations can be achieved through two crucial parameters: "population density"
control and "communication (or information transfer)" among individuals in a
crowd. The interplay of these two parameters is responsible for either breaking
or restoring the symmetry of a system. We describe how these parameters are set
by design conditions as well as crowd control. Based on these parameters, we
discuss strategies for preventing potential social disasters caused by
asymmetrical panic escape.

$\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, starting with a topological BF theory and
deforming it in accordance with microscopic symmetry. These theories have a
well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$
gauge theories and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows
that the only generic phases are in $d=2$, only the confined phase; in $d=3$,
both the confined phase and the topological BF phase; and in $d=4$, the
confined phase, the topological BF phase, and a phase with a massless photon.
We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which,
surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of
these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement --
proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude
that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but insufficient
condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and
sufficient.

                                        <span>  The nature of dark matter is a problem with too many potential solutions. We
investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate
the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a
hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group
U(1)$_{\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$_\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark matter
candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological
constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the
correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that
recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the
consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to
additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we
calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that
phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with
theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out
these dark matter models.

exactly solvable models, finding the Nappi-Witten model and its higher
dimensional generalizations. We then consider the spectra of these models
obtained by canonical quantization in light-cone gauge, and match them with an
integrability-based Bethe ansatz approach. By considering a generalized
light-cone gauge we can describe the model by a nontrivially Drinfel'd twisted
S matrix, explicitly verifying the twisted structure expected for such
deformations. Next, the reformulation of the Nappi-Witten model as a
Yang-Baxter deformation shows that Yang-Baxter models can have more symmetries
than suggested by the $r$ matrix defining the deformation. We discuss these
enhanced symmetries in more detail for some trivial and nontrivial examples.
Finally, we observe that there are nonunimodular but Weyl-invariant Yang-Baxter
models of a type not previously considered.

oriented $\mathbb C^*$-equivariant cohomology theories. Here we study the
K-theoretic refinement. It gives rational functions in $t^{1/2}$ invariant
under $t^{1/2}\leftrightarrow t^{-1/2}$ which specialise to numerical
Vafa-Witten invariants at $t=1$. On the "instanton branch" the invariants give
the virtual $\chi_{-t}^{}$-genus refinement of G\"ottsche-Kool. Applying
modularity to their calculations gives predictions for the contribution of the
"monopole branch". We calculate some cases and find perfect agreement. We also
do calculations on K3 surfaces, finding Jacobi forms refining the usual modular
forms, proving a conjecture of G\"ottsche-Kool. We determine the K-theoretic
virtual classes of degeneracy loci using Eagon-Northcott complexes, and show
they calculate refined Vafa-Witten invariants. Using this Laarakker [Laa]
proves universality results for the invariants.

holographic 2d CFTs. In the bulk, the propagator of free fields in AdS
backgrounds containing a conical defect or a BTZ black hole can be obtained by
solving the wave equation, as well as by the method of images. On the boundary,
these geometries are sourced by heavy operator insertions, and the propagator
is dual to a heavy-light (HHLL) correlator. By matching its expansion in
Virasoro blocks to our bulk results, we determine the OPE coefficients of all
contributing states in both the s and t channels. In the s channel, these
states are excitations of the light field on top of the heavy state, and their
OPE coefficients are the amplitudes to create them. The t-channel OPE is
dominated by the Virasoro vacuum block, but there is also an infinite family of
light two-particle states that contribute to the correlator. The OPE
coefficients that couple these states to heavy operators represent their
expectation values in heavy backgrounds. We determine them exactly, derive
their asymptotic form at large twist, and discuss their behavior near and above
the BTZ threshold, where they become thermal one-point functions.

of magnetic fields in the Universe and explore their potential in addressing
the matter-antimatter asymmetry. We construct consistent models that generate
the helical magnetic field consistent with observations. We also develop an
effective field theory approach to magnetogenesis, where the choice of EFT
parameters describes the magnetogenesis scenario in the early Universe, and
different choices of parameters correspond to different models. Our EFT
explicitly shows that generating primordial magnetic fields requires two
necessary conditions: conformal invariance breaking and causal propagation.
Furthermore, we establish that the presence of a strong magnetic field near
compact objects, such as neutron stars, aids in understanding the phenomenon of
Fast radio bursts through the conversion of gravitational waves to
electromagnetic waves in the background of a strong transverse magnetic field.

                                        <span>  There have been several works that have studied scalar cosmological
perturbations in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity theories to understand early
cosmic times dynamics. In this direction, the perturbations presented have been
performed by considering $f(T)$ extensions as an effective fluid-like scheme,
where the equation-of-state contains extra terms due to the torsion. In this
work, we discuss introducing a non-fluid-like approach as a direct consequence
of $f(T)$ extensions, particularly for $f(T)$ power law model scenarios. This
approach will be compared using CMB constraints data from Planck 2018 and SDSS
catalogs, showing a change in about 17% in $C_{l}$ at $l< 10^{1}$ from the ones
reported in the literature as a fluid-like approach, which will bring
significant changes in the analysis on cosmological tensions at early cosmic
times.

                                        <span>  Barrow proposed that quantum gravity effects might introduce fractal
corrections to the area of the event horizon of black holes. The area law gets
modified as $S \propto A^{1+\Delta/2}$, with $0\leq\Delta\leq 1$. It was so far
unclear whether this assumption could lead to meaningful quantum gravity
theories beyond general relativity. In this paper, we argue that this is indeed
the case. In particular, assuming $\Delta$ to be a radial function, we show
that the Barrow hypothesis, together with the Jacobson's approach can generate
non-trivial modified gravity theories.

metric includes explicitly a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) effect. We
also investigate interesting features of the geodesic equations and tidal
effects dependent on the GUP parameter $\alpha$ related to a minimum length.
Then, by solving geodesic deviation equations explicitly with appropriate
boundary conditions, we show that $\alpha$ in the effective metric affects both
the radial and angular components of the geodesic equation, particularly near
the singularities.

particle emerging from a thermal horizon of a hot
NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Anti-de Sitter (HNKNK-AdS) black hole. Considering the
tunneling formalism, we report the Hawking temperature of the charged Dirac
particle through the horizon and the heat capacity of the HNKNK-AdS black hole.
It is found that the effective Hawking temperature for the black hole depends
on the black hole's parameters, such as electric and magnetic charges, magnetic
mass, the cosmological constant, and the angular momentum of the black hole.
The Hawking radiation for the Kerr-Newman black hole is reduced. It is shown
that there is a small correction to the Hawking thermal spectrum. The heat
capacity for the HNKNK-AdS black hole is found different from the previous
work, and for the Kerr-Newman black hole is also reduced.

stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its
impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin
equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by
the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent
Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic
duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An
explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the
stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and
quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we
perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL},
g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the
diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution
featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.

                                        <span>  We present a semi-analytic binary black hole (BBH) metric approximation that
models the entire evolution of the system from inspiral to merger. The metric
is constructed as a boosted Kerr-Schild superposition following post-Newtonian
(PN) trajectories at the fourth PN order in the inspiral phase. During merger,
we interpolate the binary metric in time to a single black hole remnant with
properties obtained from numerical relativity (NR) fittings. Different from
previous approaches, the new metric can model binary black holes with arbitrary
spin direction, mass ratio, and eccentricity at any stage of their evolution in
a fast and computationally efficient way. We analyze the properties of our new
metric and we compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution. We show
that Hamiltonian constraints are well-behaved even at merger and that the mass
and spin of the black holes deviate in average only $\sim 5 \%$ compared to the
full numerical evolution. We perform a General Relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulation of uniform gas evolving on top of our
approximate metric. We compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution of
the fluid and Einstein's equations. We show that the properties of the gas such
as the accretion rate are remarkably similar between the two approaches,
exhibiting only $\sim 10 \%$ differences in average. The approximate metric is
five times more efficient among other computational advantages. The numerical
implementation of the metric is now open-source and optimized for numerical
work. We have also implemented this spacetime in the widely used GRMHD codes
Athena++ and EinsteinToolkit.

                                        <span>  We introduce a theoretical framework to alleviate the Hubble tension. This
framework is based on dynamics of a minimally coupled scalar field which either
belongs to the Brans-Dicke theory with a self-interacting potential or is the
scalar partner of f(R) gravity. These two theories are dynamically equivalent
when the Brans-Dicke parameter is zero. We will use this dynamical equivalence
to interpret the Hubble tension in the same theoretical framework. For both
theories, we write one set of field equations in which the value of a parameter
distinguishes between the two theories. We will show that H0 actually evolves
with redshift so that its value is consistent with that measured from the local
distance ladder and it drops to the value measured from CMB at high redshift.
We argue that even though both theories exhibit this behaviour, Brans-Dicke
theory with an exponential potential is more successful than power-law f(R)
gravity to relieve the Hubble tension.

                                        <span>  The coalescence of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) might explain
some of the gravitation waves (GWs) events detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. On the
other hand, observational hints for supermassive PBHs (SMPBHs) have been
accumulated. Thus it can be expected that stellar-mass PBHs might be
gravitationally bounded to SMPBHs ($\sim10^{6}-10^9M_\odot$) in the early
Universe, and both constituted primordial extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs).
In this work, we initiate the study of the merger rate for primordial EMRIs.
The corresponding intrinsic EMRI rate at low redshift may be comparable to that
of astrophysical model, $10-10^4$yr$^{-1}$, which the space-based detector LISA
has the capability to detect, but significantly raises with redshift. Though
equal mass binaries also inevitably form, we find that under certain conditions
the primordial EMRIs can be the most prevalent GW sources, and thus potentially
a new probe to PBH.

gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in
perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de
Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric
series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees
within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a
Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative
computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges
to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.

particles is used for the phenomenological description of the processes of
particle creation in strong external fields. It has been demonstrated that the

                                        <span>  This paper analyzes the effective field theory perspective on modern physics
through the lens of the quantum theory of gravitational interaction. The
historical part argues that the search for a theory of quantum gravity
stimulated the change in outlook that characterizes the modern approach to the
Standard Model of particle physics and General Relativity. We present some
landmarks covering a long period, i.e., from the beginning of the 1930s until
1994, when, according to Steven Weinberg, the modern bottom-up approach to
General Relativity began. Starting from the first attempt to apply the quantum
field theory techniques to perturbatively quantize Einstein's theory, we
explore its developments and interaction with the top-down approach encoded by
String Theory. In the last part of the paper, we focus on this last approach to
describe the relationship between our modern understanding of String Theory and
Effective Field Theory in today's panorama. To this end, the non-historical
part briefly explains the modern concepts of moduli stabilization and Swampland
to understand another change in focus that explains the present framework where
some string theorists move.

simple two-point functions in the probe approximation. We find that de Sitter
equilibrates in a superdiffusive manner, unlike most physical systems which
equilibrate diffusively. We also examine the scrambling time. In de Sitter, the
two-point functions of free fields do not decay for sometime because quanta can
reflect off the pole of the static patch. This suggests a minimum scrambling
time of the order $\log(1/G_N)$, even for perturbations introduced on the
stretched horizon, indicating fast scrambling inside de Sitter static patch. We
also discuss the interplay between thermodynamic temperature and inverse
correlation time, sometimes called "tomperature".

                                        <span>  A new hierarchy of lasting gravitational-wave effects (the higher memory
effects) was recently identified in asymptotically flat spacetimes, with the
better-known displacement, spin, and center-of-mass memory effects included as
the lowest two orders in the set of these effects. These gravitational-wave
observables are determined by a set of temporal moments of the news tensor,
which describes gravitational radiation from an isolated source. The moments of
the news can be expressed in terms of changes in charge-like expressions and
integrals over retarded time of flux-like terms, some of which vanish in the
absence of radiation. In this paper, we compute expressions for the flux-like
contributions to the moments of the news in terms of a set of multipoles that
characterize the gravitational-wave strain. We also identify a part of the
strain that gives rise to these moments of the news. In the context of
post-Newtonian theory, we show that the strain related to the moments of the
news is responsible for the many nonlinear, instantaneous terms and "memory"
terms that appear in the post-Newtonian expressions for the radiative multipole
moments of the strain. We also apply our results to compute the leading
post-Newtonian expressions for the moments of the news and the corresponding
strains that are generated during the inspiral of compact binary sources. These
results provide a new viewpoint on the waveforms computed from the multipolar
post-Minkowski formalism, and they could be used to assess the detection
prospects of this new class of higher memory effects.

                                        <span>  When gravitational waves pass near a gravitating object, they are deflected,
or lensed. If the object is massive, such that the wavelength of the waves is
small compared to its gravitational size, lensed gravitational wave events can
be identified when multiple signals are detected at different times. However,
when the wavelength is long, wave-optics diffraction effects will be important,
and a lensed event can be identified by looking for frequency-dependent
modulations to the gravitational waveform, without having to associate multiple
signals. For current ground-based gravitational wave detectors observing
stellar-mass binary compact object mergers, wave-optics effects are important
for lenses with masses $\lesssim 1000 M_{\odot}$. Therefore, minihalos below
this mass range could potentially be identified by lensing diffraction. The
challenge with analyzing these events is that the frequency-dependent lensing
modulation, or the amplification factor, is prohibitively expensive to compute
for Bayesian parameter inference. In this work, we use a novel time-domain
method to construct interpolators of the amplification factor for the
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), generalized singular isothermal sphere (gSIS) and
cored isothermal sphere (CIS) lens models. Using these interpolators, we
perform Bayesian inference on gravitational-wave signals lensed by minihalos
injected in mock detector noise, assuming current sensitivity of ground-based
detectors. We find that we could potentially identify an event when it is
lensed by minihalos and extract the values of all lens parameters in addition
to the parameters of the GW source. All of the methods are implemented in
Glworia, the accompanying open-source Python package, and can be generalized to
study lensed signals detected by current and next-generation detectors.

derive constraints on the transition redshift from cosmic deceleration to
acceleration. This is achieved using observational Hubble data, Type Ia
Supernovae Pantheon+ samples and Baryon acoustic oscillations. In this
parametrization, the value of the initial $q$ parameter is $q_{i}$, the final
value is $q_f$, the present value is denoted by $q_{0}$, and the transition
duration is given by $\alpha$. We perform our calculations using the Monte
Carlo Markov Chain method, utilizing the emcee package. Under the assumption of
a flat geometry, we constrain the range of possible values for three scenarios:
when $q_{f}$ is unrestricted, when $q_{f}$ is equal to $-1$, and when $\alpha$
is $1/3$. This is done assuming that $q_{i}=1/2$. Here, we achieve that the
$SN$ data fixes the free parameters tightly as in the flat $\Lambda$CDM for
unrestricted $q_{f}$. In addition, if we fix $q_{f}=-1$, the model behaves well
as the $\Lambda$CDM for the combined dataset. We also acquire the current value
of the deceleration parameter, which is consistent with the latest results that
assume the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we observe a deviation from the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the current model based on the evolution of
$j(z)$, and it is evident that the universe transitions from deceleration to
acceleration and will eventually reach the $\Lambda$CDM model in the near
future.

analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without
the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role
of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. For an arbitrary
number of fields we derive the criteria that can lead to an exponential
amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving
the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results
on a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light" scenario and show how the
presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the

                                        <span>  The spacetime short-distance structure at the Planck scale is governed by the
Planck length, usually interpreted as a three-dimensional Euclidian length. As
such, it is not Lorentz invariant and clashes with Einstein's special
relativity, which is thus unable to describe the Planck scale kinematics. The
solution to this problem is twofold. First, one has to re-interpret the Planck
length as a Lorentz invariant four-dimensional pseudo-length. Second, to comply
with a non-vanishing cosmological term~$\Lambda$, one has to replace the
standard Poincar\'e-invariant special relativity with the de Sitter-invariant
special relativity. Since the Planck pseudo-length does not clash with the de
Sitter-invariant special relativity, it provides a consistent description of
the Planck scale kinematics in the presence of~$\Lambda$. Under the above
replacement, general relativity changes to the de Sitter-invariant general
relativity, in which~$\Lambda$ is constitutive. In this paper, the ensuing
Friedmann equations are derived, and some implications for cosmology are
explored and discussed.

Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical
symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all
nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated
perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and
electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and
obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of
obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the
scalar-vector-tensor theory.

                                        <span>  We study single-field slow-roll inflation embedded in Palatini $F(R)$ gravity
where $F(R)$ grows faster than $R^2$. Surprisingly, the consistency of the
theory requires the Jordan frame inflaton potential to be unbounded from below.
Even more surprisingly, this corresponds to an Einstein frame inflaton
potential bounded from below and positive definite. We prove that for all such
Palatini $F(R)$'s, there exists a universal strong coupling limit corresponding
to a quadratic $F(R)$ with the wrong sign for the linear term and a
cosmological constant in the Jordan frame. In such a limit, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ does not depend on the original inflaton potential,
while the scalar spectral index $n_s$ does. Unfortunately, the system is
ill-defined out of the slow-roll regime. A possible way out is to upgrade to a
$F(R,X)$ model, with $X$ the Jordan frame inflaton kinetic term. Such a
modification essentially leaves the inflationary predictions unaffected.

region of the Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensional spacetime. Under the
Newman-Unti gauge, we derive the most general near horizon symmetry and
solution space without any near horizon fall-off condition. There are four
towers of surface charges that are generic functions on the horizon associated
to the near horizon symmetry. With suitable near horizon fall-off conditions,
we reveal a soft graviton theorem from the Ward identity of the near horizon
supertranslation in both coordinates space and momentum space.

coupling that incorporates classical spin effects. The construction relies on
the introduction of a new covariant derivative, which we name "classical spin
covariant derivative", that is compatible with the three-point interaction of
the $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$ solution with the gauge field. The resulting
Lagrangian, beside the correct three-point coupling, predicts a unique choice
for contact terms and therefore it can be used to compute higher-point
amplitudes such as the Compton, unaffected by spurious poles. Using double-copy
techniques we use this theory to extract gravity amplitudes and observables
that are relevant to describe Kerr binary dynamics to all orders in the spin.
In particular, we compute the 2PM ($\mathcal{O}(G^2_N)$) $2\rightarrow 2$
scattering amplitude between two classically spinning objects to all orders in
the spin and use it to extract the 2PM scattering angle.

Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate
the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative
Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late
Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational
effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the
mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed
and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable
predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the
effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal
gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address
the dark energy problem.

                                        <span>  We propose a new model of cosmology based on an anisotropic background and a
specific $f(R)$ theory of gravity. It is shown that field equations of $f(R)$
gravity in a Bianchi type I background give rise to a modified Friedmann
equation. This model contains two important parameters: $\gamma$ and $\delta$.
We, thus, simply call our model $\gamma\delta$CDM. It is distinguished in two
important aspects from the $\Lambda$CDM model: firstly, the contribution of
different energy densities to the Hubble parameter are weighted with different
weights, and then, dependence of energy densities to redshift is modified as
well. This unorthodox relation of energy content to Hubble parameter brings
forth a new way of interpreting the cosmological history. This solution does
not allow the existence of a cosmological constant component, however, a dark
energy contribution with dependence on redshift is possible. We tested
observational relevance of the new solution by best fitting to different data
sets. We found that our model could accommodate the idea of cosmological
coupling of black holes.

                                        <span>  The nature of dark matter is a problem with too many potential solutions. We
investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate
the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a
hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group
U(1)$_{\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$_\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark matter
candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological
constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the
correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that
recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the
consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to
additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we
calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that
phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with
theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out
these dark matter models.

${\langle\hat{N}\rangle}$ of the particle number operator for a quantum field
gives rise to the perception of thermal radiation in the vicinity of a black
hole. This Hawking effect has been examined only for observers asymptotically
far from a Kerr black hole; here we generalize the analysis to various classes
of freely falling observers both outside and inside the Kerr event horizon. Of
note, we find that the effective temperature of the ${\langle\hat{N}\rangle}$
distribution remains regular for observers at the event horizon but becomes
negative and divergent for observers reaching the inner Cauchy horizon.
Furthermore, the perception of Hawking radiation varies greatly for different
classes of observers, though the spectrum is generally a graybody that
decreases in intensity with black hole spin and increases in temperature when
looking toward the edges of the black hole shadow.

renormalized strong coupling via the gradient flow. This is done adopting the
Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to deal with the infamous topological
freezing problem that affects standard local updating algorithms. We show that,
even in the presence of severe topological freezing, both algorithms yield the
same strong coupling once projected onto a fixed topological sector. Moreover,
we show that using a non-projected definition of the coupling leads to the same
step-scaling sequence. This means that projecting the coupling onto a fixed
topological sector does not affect the determination of the
dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$.

                                        <span>  Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the
$\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole
moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been
found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP
problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the
extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta > 0$ at large
distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole
moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the
infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological
charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a
limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the
inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero
mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies, beyond doubt, that CP is conserved
in the strong interaction.

                                        <span>  We fit the three finestructure constants of the Standard Model with three, in
first approximation theoretically estimable parameters, 1) a
"unifiedscale",turning out not equal to the Planck scale and thus only
estimable by a very speculative story, 2) a "number of layers" being a priori
the number of families, and 3) a unified coupling related to a critical
coupling on a lattice. So formally we postdict the three fine structure
constants! In the philosophy of our model there is a physically lattice theory
with link variables taking values in a (or in the various) "small"
representations of the Standard Model Group. We argue for that these
representations functio in first approximation as were the theory a genuine
$SU(5)$ theory. Next we take into account fluctuation of the gauge fields in
the lattice and obtain a correction to the a priori $SU(5)$ approximation,
because of course the link fluctuations not corresponding any Standard model
Lie algebra, but only to the SU(5), do not exist. The model is a development of
our old anti-grand-unification model having as its genuine gauge group, close
to fundamental scale, a cross product of the standard model group S(U(3)x U(2))
with itself, there being one Cartesian product factor for each family. In these
old works we included the hypotesis of "multiple point criticallity principle"
which here effectively means the coupling constants be critical on the lattice.
Counted relative to the Higgs scale we suggest the in our sense "unified scale"
(where the deviations between the inverse fine structure constants deviate by
quantum fluctuations being only from standard model groups, not SU(5)) makes up
the 2/3 th power of the Planck scale relative to the Higgs scale, or better the
top quark mass scale.

                                        <span>  Motivated by the observation of $\Xi_b(6227)$ state, in this study
considering $\Xi_b(6227)$ has a molecular structure, we calculate magnetic
moment of this state in quark model. The magnetic moment of a hadron gives
valuable information about the internal structure and shape deformations. We
observe that orbital excitation of $\Xi_b(6227)$ molecular state change the
results of magnetic moment significantly. We also observe that light quarks in
$\Xi_b(6227)$ molecular state determine magnetic moment. Measurement of the
magnetic moment of $\Xi_b(6227)$ can clarify the nature of this state and be
useful to identify the quantum numbers.

increases. We make use of anisotropic lattice QCD simulations with $N_f = 2 +
1$ dynamical flavours. After determining the positive and negative parity
ground state masses at the lowest temperature, we investigate the effect of
rising temperature using ratios of thermal lattice correlators with both
so-called reconstructed correlators and with simple model correlators. This
avoids difficulties associated with non-zero temperature fitting or spectral
reconstruction. We find that temperature effects are prominent throughout the
hadronic phase for all negative parity channels considered and for some
positive parity channels. Subsequently and where possible, we determine the
masses of the ground states as a function of temperature. Finally we consider
the effect of chiral symmetry restoration and extract an estimate of the
pseudocritical temperature from singly charmed baryonic correlators.

                                        <span>  We analyze the phases of theories which only have a microscopic
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, starting with a topological BF theory and
deforming it in accordance with microscopic symmetry. These theories have a
well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$
gauge theories and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows
that the only generic phases are in $d=2$, only the confined phase; in $d=3$,
both the confined phase and the topological BF phase; and in $d=4$, the
confined phase, the topological BF phase, and a phase with a massless photon.
We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which,
surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of
these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement --
proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude
that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but insufficient
condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and
sufficient.

the interacting ground state of a fermionic Hamiltonian. Using Givens rotation,
we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout
the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate
our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the
Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the
the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we
characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more
complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we
perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our
method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.

                                        <span>  Randomized measurement protocols, including classical shadows, entanglement
tomography, and randomized benchmarking are powerful techniques to estimate
observables, perform state tomography, or extract the entanglement properties
of quantum states. While unraveling the intricate structure of quantum states
is generally difficult and resource-intensive, quantum systems in nature are
often tightly constrained by symmetries. This can be leveraged by the
symmetry-conscious randomized measurement schemes we propose, yielding clear
advantages over symmetry-blind randomization such as reducing measurement
costs, enabling symmetry-based error mitigation in experiments, allowing
differentiated measurement of (lattice) gauge theory entanglement structure,
and, potentially, the verification of topologically ordered states in existing
and near-term experiments. Crucially, unlike symmetry-blind randomized
measurement protocols, these latter tasks can be performed without relearning
symmetries via full reconstruction of the density matrix.
