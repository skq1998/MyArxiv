In precision experiments to date (on\nHD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level\n$v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For\nthese transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the\nhigh-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This\nprevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from\nexperimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially\nlimited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of\nmass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies\nbetween levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio\nis positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED\ncontributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently\ndetermined from a joint analysis of several measurements.

Additionally, it remains unclear even in theory\nwhere exactly these advantages are rooted within quantum systems because the\nlogarithmic complexity commonly associated with quantum algorithms is also\npresent in algorithms based on tensor networks.

Fyodorov on random linear systems with quadratic constraints, using\ntools from Random Matrix Theory and replicas. These notes illustrate and\ncomplement the material presented at the Summer School organised within the\nPuglia Summer Trimester 2023 in Bari (Italy). Consider a system of $M$ linear\nequations in $N$ unknowns, $\\sum_{j=1}^N A_{kj}x_j=b_k$ for $k=1,\\ldots,M$,\nsubject to the constraint that the solutions live on the $N$-sphere,\n$x_1^2+\\ldots + x_N^2=N$. Assume that both the coefficients $A_{ij}$ and the\nparameters $b_i$ be independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Using\ntwo different approaches -- based on Random Matrix Theory and on a replica\ncalculation -- it is possible to compute whether a large linear system subject\nto a quadratic constraint is typically solvable or not, as a function of the\nratio $\\alpha=M/N$ and the variance $\\sigma^2$ of the $b_i$'s. This is done by\ndefining a quadratic loss function $H({\\bf\nx})=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^M\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^NA_{kj} x_j-b_k\\right]^2$ and\ncomputing the statistics of its minimal value on the sphere,\n$E_{min}=\\min_{||\\bf x||^2=N}H({\\bf x})$, which is zero if the system is\ncompatible, and larger than zero if it is incompatible. One finds that there\nexists a compatibility threshold $0<\\alpha_c<1$, such that systems with\n$\\alpha>\\alpha_c$ are typically incompatible. This means that even weakly\nunder-complete linear systems could become typically incompatible if forced to\nadditionally obey a quadratic constraint.\n","authors":["Pierpaolo Vivo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03209v2.pdf","comment":"46 pag, 5 fig.

If the object is massive, such that the wavelength of the waves is\nsmall compared to its gravitational size, lensed gravitational wave events can\nbe identified when multiple signals are detected at different times. However,\nwhen the wavelength is long, wave-optics diffraction effects will be important,\nand a lensed event can be identified by looking for frequency-dependent\nmodulations to the gravitational waveform, without having to associate multiple\nsignals. For current ground-based gravitational wave detectors observing\nstellar-mass binary compact object mergers, wave-optics effects are important\nfor lenses with masses $\\lesssim 1000 M_{\\odot}$. Therefore, minihalos below\nthis mass range could potentially be identified by lensing diffraction.

Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with\ncompact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or\nquantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly\ntraining the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards\nlow-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Quantum\ninformation tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to\nlocal scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly\naffect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum\ninformation in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to\nlarge-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently\nintroduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different\nscales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which\nwe employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a\ncontrolled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems\nup to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by\nsolving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the\ninformation flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale\ninformation. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the\nmicroscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at\nwhich information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to\naccurately obtain the information flow.

In the\ncase where the full symmetry group is $K\\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry\nand $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are\nclassified by $H^{d+2}(K\\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial\ndimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we\ngenerally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases\nas long as the weak symmetry is imposed.\n  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching\" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy\nphysics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time\ndynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems.\nNotably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state\nshows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We\ndiscuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such\nunconventional boundary correlation.

We further show that the\nexistence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the\ntime dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory\ncontains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem\nprovides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit,\nwhere the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of\nquantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral\nlimit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total\nflux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states\ninto neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We\ndemonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely\nflatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component\ninto a configuration with a non-zero total flux.

In\nfact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs\nboson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called\n``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years.\nWe consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and\nindirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the\nnuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale\n(i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly\naccessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After\ndiscussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we\nsummarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions.\nIn particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates.\nDiscovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.\n","authors":["Andreas Crivellin","Bruce Mellado"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03870v2.pdf","comment":"27 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

The honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ recently emerged as a\ncandidate host for both bond-dependent (e.g. Kitaev) and third-neighbor ($J_3$)\ninteractions, and has become a model experimental system due to its relatively\nlow levels of disorder. Understanding the relative importance of different\nexchange interactions holds the key to achieving novel ground states, such as\nquantum spin liquids. Here, we use the magnetotropic susceptibility to map out\nthe intermediate and high-field phase diagram of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ as a\nfunction of the out-of-plane magnetic field direction at $T = 1.6$ K. We show\nthat the experimental data are qualitatively consistent with classical Monte\nCarlo results of the XXZ-$J_1$-$J_3$ model with small Kitaev and off-diagonal\nexchange couplings included.

An elegant route to convert laser light into single\nphotons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the\nstrong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this\nmethod remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach\nwhere laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively\ninterfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a\ncavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by\nmeasuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided\noptical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the\nPurcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving\nfield with the cavity output field.

Here we propose an interference-based approach\nwhere laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively\ninterfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a\ncavity coupling to a single quantum emitter.

However, since the metric perturbation $h_{\\mu\\nu}$ is an\nintrinsically relativistic object, a consistent coupling to GWs can only be\nobtained within a relativistic (and, in fact generally covariant) theory of\nelasticity. We develop such a formalism using the methods of modern effective\nfield theories, and we use it to provide a derivation of the interaction of\nelastic bodies with GWs valid also in the high-frequency regime, providing a\nfirst-principle derivation of Dyson's result (and partially correcting it). We\nalso stress that the field-theoretical results are obtained working in the TT\nframe, while the description in terms of a force driving the normal modes is\nonly valid in the proper detector frame.

The critical points $CP_{1}$ and $CP_{2}$ are observed to occur at the\nmaximum extreme points of temperature in the isobaric curve, while the critical\npoint $CP_{3}$, emerges at the minimum extreme points of temperature.\nFurthermore, the number of phases at the novel critical point exhibits an\nupward trend, followed by a subsequent decline at the conventional critical\npoints. With the increase of the coupling constant ($\\alpha = 1$), although the\nsystem has three critical points, only the conventional $CP_{1}$ is a\n(physical) critical point, and the conventional $CP_{2}$ serves as the phase\nannihilation point. This means that the coupling constant $\\alpha$ has a\nnon-negligible effect on the phase structure.\n","authors":["Hao Chen","Meng-Yao Zhang","Hassan Hassanabadi","Bekir Can Lütfüoğlu","Zheng-Wen Long"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14730v2.pdf","comment":"10 pages, 18 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07063v3","updated":"2024-03-25T05:39:14Z","published":"2023-11-13T04:06:03Z","title":"Sagnac-type neutron displacement-noise-free interferometeric\n  gravitational-wave detector","summary":"  The detection of low-frequency gravitational waves on Earth requires the\nreduction of displacement noise, which dominates the low-frequency band.

The\ndifference in these two values for the orbital period is generally referred to\nas the gravito-magnetic (GM) clock effect. It has been proposed to measure the\nGM clock effect using atomic clocks carried by satellites in prograde and\nretrograde orbits around the Earth. The precision and stability required for\nsatellites to accurately perform this measurement remains a challenge for\ncurrent instrumentation. One of the most accurate clocks in the Universe is a\nmillisecond pulsar, which emits periodic radio pulses with high stability.\nTiming of the pulsed signals from millisecond pulsars has proven to be very\nsuccessful in testing predictions of general relativity and the GM clock effect\nis potentially measurable in binary systems. In this work we derive the generic\nGM clock effect by considering a slowly-spinning binary system on an elliptical\norbit, with both arbitrary mass ratio and arbitrary spin orientations. The\nspin-orbit interaction introduces a perturbation to the orbit, causing the\norbital plane to precess and nutate. We identify several different\ncontributions to the clock effects: the choice of spin supplementary condition\nand the observer-dependent definition of a full revolution and\n\"nearly-identical\" orbits.

Our predicted DWD binary\ndistribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only\ngravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we\npredict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral\nafter the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences\nin the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In\nthat case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in\nthe GW-only scenario.

The distinctive feature of this\nenvironment is that the equations of motion of the rays are independent of the\nplasma velocity, which, however, is not the case in other media. In this paper,\nwe consider the deflection of light rays propagating near a spherically\nsymmetric gravitating object in a moving dispersive medium given by a general\nrefractive index. The deflection is studied when the motion of the medium is\ndefined either as a radially falling onto a gravitating object (e.g., black\nhole), or rotating in the equatorial plane. For both cases the deflection\nangles are obtained. These examples demonstrate that fully analytic expressions\ncan be obtained if the Hamiltonian for the rays takes a rather general form as\na polynomial in a given momentum component. The general expressions are further\napplied to three specific choices of refractive indices and these cases are\ncompared. Furthermore, the light rays propagating around a gravitating object\nsurrounded by a generally moving medium are further studied as a small\nperturbation of the cold plasma model. The deflection angle formula is hence\nexpressed as a sum of zeroth and first order components, where the zeroth order\nterm corresponds to the known cold plasma case and the first order correction\ncan be interpreted as caused by small difference in the refractive index\ncompared to the cold plasma.

It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the\nwidespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead\nnecessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts.\nI conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist\nversions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the\nneed for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration\nprinciple for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.\n","authors":["Timotheus Riedel"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04069v2.pdf","comment":"32 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05580v3","updated":"2024-03-23T19:39:08Z","published":"2023-02-11T02:50:26Z","title":"Generation of genuine all-way entanglement in defect-nuclear spin\n  systems through dynamical decoupling sequences","summary":"  Multipartite entangled states are an essential resource for sensing, quantum\nerror correction, and cryptography. Color centers in solids are one of the\nleading platforms for quantum networking due to the availability of a nuclear\nspin memory that can be entangled with the optically active electronic spin\nthrough dynamical decoupling sequences. Creating electron-nuclear entangled\nstates in these systems is a difficult task as the always-on hyperfine\ninteractions prohibit complete isolation of the target dynamics from the\nunwanted spin bath. While this emergent cross-talk can be alleviated by\nprolonging the entanglement generation, the gate durations quickly exceed\ncoherence times. Here we show how to prepare high-quality GHZ$_M$-like states\nwith minimal cross-talk. We introduce the $M$-tangling power of an evolution\noperator, which allows us to verify genuine all-way correlations.

In this work, we utilise tensor network methods to systematically\nprobe the role of entanglement in the working of two variational quantum\nalgorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum\nNeural Networks (QNNs), on prototypical problems under controlled entanglement\nenvironments. We find that for the MAX-CUT problem solved using QAOA, the\nfidelity as a function of entanglement is highly dependent on the number of\nlayers, layout of edges in the graph, and edge density, generally exhibiting\nthat a high number of layers indicates a higher resilience to truncation of\nentanglement. This is in contrast to previous studies based on no more than\nfour QAOA layers which show that the fidelity of QAOA follows a scaling law\nwith respect to the entanglement per qubit of the system. Contrarily, in the\ncase of QNNs, trained circuits with high test accuracies are underpinned by\nhigher entanglement, with any enforced limitation in entanglement resulting in\na sharp decline in test accuracy.

Incomplete noise models have led to discrepancies between\nquantum program success rate (SR) estimates and actual machine outcomes. For\nexample, the estimated probability of success (ESP) is the state-of-the-art\nmetric used to gauge quantum program performance. The ESP suffers poor\nprediction since it fails to account for the unique combination of circuit\nstructure, quantum state, and quantum computer properties specific to each\nprogram execution. Thus, an urgent need exists for a systematic approach that\ncan elucidate various noise impacts and accurately and robustly predict quantum\ncomputer success rates, emphasizing application and device scaling. In this\narticle, we propose quantum vulnerability analysis (QVA) to systematically\nquantify the error impact on quantum applications and address the gap between\ncurrent success rate (SR) estimators and real quantum computer results. The QVA\ndetermines the cumulative quantum vulnerability (CQV) of the target quantum\ncomputation, which quantifies the quantum error impact based on the entire\nalgorithm applied to the target quantum machine. By evaluating the CQV with\nwell-known benchmarks on three 27-qubit quantum computers, the CQV success\nestimation outperforms the estimated probability of success state-of-the-art\nprediction technique by achieving on average six times less relative prediction\nerror, with best cases at 30 times, for benchmarks with a real SR rate above\n0.1%. Direct application of QVA has been provided that helps researchers choose\na promising compiling strategy at compile time.\n","authors":["Fang Qi","Kaitlin N.

This transition in turn indicates a loss of information in the\nholographically dual emergent spacetime.

How well such techniques work is thought to depend strongly on\nhow noisy the underlying gates are. Weakly-entangling gates, like\n$R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ for small angles $\\theta$, can be much less noisy than\nentangling Clifford gates, like CNOT and CZ, and they arise naturally in\ncircuits used to simulate quantum dynamics. However, such weakly-entangling\ngates are non-Clifford, and are therefore incompatible with two of the most\nprominent error mitigation techniques to date: probabilistic error cancellation\n(PEC) and the related form of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). This paper\ngeneralizes these techniques to non-Clifford gates, and comprises two\ncomplementary parts. The first part shows how to effectively transform any\ngiven quantum channel into (almost) any desired channel, at the cost of a\nsampling overhead, by adding random Pauli gates and processing the measurement\noutcomes. This enables us to cancel or properly amplify noise in non-Clifford\ngates, provided we can first characterize such gates in detail. The second part\ntherefore introduces techniques to do so for noisy $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gates.\nThese techniques are robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors,\nand exhibit concentration and sensitivity--crucial features in many\nexperiments. They are related to randomized benchmarking, and may also be of\ninterest beyond the context of error mitigation. We find that while\nnon-Clifford gates can be less noisy than related Cliffords, their noise is\nfundamentally more complex, which can lead to surprising and sometimes unwanted\neffects in error mitigation. Whether this trade-off can be broadly advantageous\nremains to be seen.\n","authors":["David Layden","Bradley Mitchell","Karthik Siva"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18793v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18790v1","updated":"2024-03-27T17:34:50Z","published":"2024-03-27T17:34:50Z","title":"Squeezing below the ground state of motion of a continuously monitored\n  levitating nanoparticle","summary":"  Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and\nquantum sensing.

Using wavefront shaping to\ncompensate for the scattering and retrieve the two-photon correlations is\nchallenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the two-photon signal.\nWhile previous works partly addressed this challenge by using feedback from a\nstrong classical laser beam that co-propagates with the entangled photons, such\nmethods frequently depend on assumptions about the complex medium, limiting the\napplicability of quantum wavefront shaping. In this work, we propose and\ndemonstrate a new feedback mechanism that is inspired by Klyshko's advanced\nwave picture, in which the classical laser beam counter-propagates with one of\nthe entangled photons and co-propagates with the other. The new Klyshko\nfeedback allows compensation of scattering in thick samples and even in\nsituations where each photon propagates through a different scattering medium.\nSince the advanced wave picture applies whenever optical reciprocity is valid,\nsuch Klyshko optimization can be utilized across a wide range of\nconfigurations, offering a robust and alignment-free setup.

However, even when the secular equation, which provides the\nspeed of the surface wave, can be explicitly derived, the analysis is limited\nto specific cases due to its cumbersome final expression. In this work, we\npresent an alternative method based on linear algebra tools, to deal with the\nsecular equation for surface waves in an isotropic elastic half-space subjected\nto non-standard boundary conditions of impedance type. They are defined by\nproportional relationships between both the stress and velocity components at\nthe surface, with complex proportional ratios.

This turbulent regime leads to energy\ndissipation across smaller and smaller scales, resulting in a fractal\ndistribution of eddies throughout physical space.

However, a particle in the\n$N$-body system represents a huge collection of dark-matter particles, whose\naverage thermal velocity is very close to zero. We consider justification of\nthe procedure of adding thermal velocities in $N$-body simulations and build a\nsimple model of their influence on the power spectrum. Our model captures the\nphysical effect of suppression of the power spectrum at small wave numbers and\nalso explains its artificial enhancement at large wave numbers, observed in\nnumerical simulations with added thermal velocities. The cause of this\nenhancement is the disturbance of the growth rate of the density profile\nintroduced when adding random initial thermal velocities. Specifically, the\nmodel predicts a turnover in the behavior of the simulated power spectrum at a\ncertain wave number $k_*$, beyond which it grows as $P (k) \\propto k^2$. Our\ntreatment is generalized to a system consisting of several matter components\nwith different thermal velocity dispersion.

The theory predicts a bounce for the universe at the Planck scale and\nresolves the singularity of standard cosmology. The dynamics is also governed\nby an effective Hamiltonian, which predicts a modified Friedmann equation\ncontaining the quadratic terms of the energy density. The term plays an\nessential role in the high energy regime, but the equations return to the\nstandard form in the low energy regime. The evolution of the universe in the\npre-inflationary period is studied in the framework of loop quantum cosmology,\nwhere the DBI scalar field is assumed to be the dominant component of the\nuniverse. Using the numerical method, we provide the evolution of the DBI\nfield. The background evolution shows that there are three phases as: bouncing\nphase, transition phase and slow-roll inflationary phase. There is also a short\nperiod of super-inflation just at the beginning of the bounce phase. The field\nfirst climbs the potential and then reaches the turning point where\n$\\dot{\\phi}$ disappears and the potential energy becomes the dominant part of\nthe energy density. This is the time when the slow roll inflation begins and\nthe field slowly rolls down the potential. The results indicate that there are\na few e-fold expansions in the bounce phase, about $N = $, and the universe\nexperiences about $N = 59$ e-fold expansions in the slow-roll inflation phase.\n","authors":["Abolhassan Mohammadi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18289v1.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15158v2","updated":"2024-03-27T06:07:57Z","published":"2024-03-22T12:13:44Z","title":"Magnetic Bianchi-I cosmology in the Horndeski theory","summary":"  We study the evolution of Bianchi-I space-times within the framework of the\nHorndeski theory with $G_5=\\text{const}/X$.
